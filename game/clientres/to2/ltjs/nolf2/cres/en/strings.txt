2700 "UNITY has sent Cate Archer to Japan to investigate a rumored international crime convention expected to take place in the pastoral village of Inotakimura. Her objective is to photograph the meeting's participants without arousing their suspicion.\n\nHer first task will be to locate agent Isamu Hatori, who will provide further information on her assignment. He's waiting somewhere in the village."
2701 "The meeting is scheduled to take place at the estate of an enigmatic figure known only as The Director. Cate will have to infiltrate the estate grounds, locate the main house, and find the window Hatori-san indicated on the map. This vantage should allow her to take the photographs she needs without exposing herself to unnecessary risk.\n\nOnce she's obtained the photos, she must return to the bridge where Yamata-san is waiting. A UNITY intercept team is standing by to evacuate her to Tokyo when the mission is complete."
2702 "Spy plane photographs show a run-down, understaffed military base, but Mr. Barnes warns that this decrepitude is likely a ruse. Although the Americans often greatly overestimate Soviet military capacity, UNITY isn't taking any chances.\n\nThe first phase of Cate's mission is to facilitate her own escape. A little sabotage should go a long way toward preventing reinforcements from being called in.\n\nSanta has enlisted a pilot who is familiar with the region to get Cate in and out. She must protect him at all costs."
2703 "After analyzing the Americans' intelligence data, UNITY is convinced that Project: Omega is headquartered in the Main Records Building at the center of the compound. Security will be tight, so it won't be easy for Cate to reach the target site, let alone get inside and recover the data she requires.\n\nFortunately, she's going in under the cover of night, which should afford some small advantage."
2704 "Now that Cate has recovered information on Project: Omega, she faces the even greater challenge of getting it out of the Soviet Union. To complicate matters further, both the Russians and H.A.R.M. are hunting for her.\n\nShe'll have to cross her fingers and hope that her meticulous preparations pay off. The night is about to light up."
2705 "Without any other compelling leads to follow, Cate heads to Akron, Ohio to search for clues at the former residence of the notorious Melvin Blitzny. Blitzny, a vacuum cleaner salesman by trade, had been groomed to assume the identity of UNITY operative Tom Goodman as part of H.A.R.M.'s last despicable plot. He met his end at the hands of his own mentor.\n\nWhatever trepidation Cate may feel at entering the domain of this treacherous man must be set aside if she is to achieve her goal."
2706 "Magnus Armstrong has contacted his old friend Kamal, a disillusioned H.A.R.M. operative in India who promises his assistance. While Kamal isn't familiar with Project: Omega, he's certain any pertinent information can be found in the central vault at the Indian headquarters.\n\nBruno has concluded that a direct infiltration of the compound is too risky given the intense security Cate would likely face. Therefore, Kamal will help her accomplish perhaps her strangest objective thus far: to get a job with H.A.R.M. Once hired, she'll have the security clearance necessary to move about the compound freely."
2707 "Having proven her value to H.A.R.M., Cate has secured a job with the very organization she has vowed to destroy. A higher security clearance should help her get close to the prize: the main vault. There she hopes to find the missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nUnfortunately, the vault is off limits to all but the highest ranking H.A.R.M. employees, so the biggest challenge still lies ahead. If only she could have unearthed better intelligence about the security countermeasures she must face."
2708 "The trail of clues has led Cate and Armstrong to a secret facility in Antarctica where H.A.R.M. is conducting Project: Omega. Once they discover its actual nature, they can plot a means of disrupting it.\n\nAssuming they don't strangle each other first."
2709 "Because of Cate's success in India, The Director has ordered the destruction of H.A.R.M.'s Indian headquarters as punishment. The attack will provide an ideal field test for the super soldiers before they are sent to Khios on their primary mission.\n\nAlthough Cate has recovered vital information on Project: Omega, she has decided to proceed directly to India in hopes of averting the tragedy that is likely to unfold once the assault begins."
2710 "With the technical specifications she recovered from the Antarctic facility, Cate feels confident that Doctor Schenker can come up with a means of combating the super soldiers.\n\nMeanwhile, the news that Armstrong is alive and in the custody of H.A.R.M. has given her a clear sense of purpose. She must find out where he is and devise a plan to rescue him.\n"
2711 "Cate has snuck aboard H.A.R.M.'s top secret underwater base in an effort to rescue Magnus Armstrong from certain death. Her first task will be to locate him. Information on his whereabouts should be stored in the supercomputer.\n\nOnce Armstrong is free, the two of them will have to improvise an escape route, as Cate's shark mini-sub only seats one."
2712 "With the underwater base collapsing around them and a rogue super soldier on the loose, Cate and Armstrong must work together to escape from this watery grave.\n\nAssuming they can even find a way off the base, they'll still have to contend with well armed and equally desperate H.A.R.M. personnel fighting for their own lives."
2713 "After falling into the hands of H.A.R.M., Cate finds herself in a needlessly elaborate but nonetheless perilous death trap. She'll need quick reflexes and extraordinary judgment to emerge unscathed.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation in the Sea of Marmara is getting bleaker by the hour. If she's going to derail H.A.R.M.'s nefarious machinations, she'd better do it quickly.\n"
2714 "The world teeters on the brink of nuclear catastrophe, with the United States and Soviet Union closer to war than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Again, the fate of humanity hinges upon the sovereignty of a tiny island nation. \n\nH.A.R.M.'s super soldiers are en route to Khios aboard an undetectable submarine designed to bypass the inevitable NATO blockade. The Americans can't send in troops to defend the island without provoking the Soviets, and yet the Soviets are claiming they are powerless to stop the invasion. Both sides are locked in a deadly standoff, but it is H.A.R.M.'s finger on the trigger."
2715 "Cate has snuck aboard H.A.R.M.'s top secret underwater base for reasons we don't want to disclose in this demo for fear of spoiling surprises should you decide to play the game. Suffice to say she has a mission to accomplish and the portion of it you are about to sample is merely the introduction."
2716 "A routine mission has gone disastrously awry and now Cate Archer is in serious trouble. She's probably halfway to the rendezvous point by now with ninjas swarming after her.\n\nThe UNITY intercept team that was to evacuate her to Tokyo must now rush to her aid. The objective is simple: get Cate out of there in one piece.\n"
2717 "Cate has managed to escape from a remote Soviet military base with crucial information on Project: Omega. She obtained this data from a super computer that appears to have been supplied and monitored by H.A.R.M.\n\nA UNITY intercept team has been sent in to mop up. The team's primary objective is to put that computer out of commission once and for all.\n\nThe team is being airdropped inside the base perimeter and will rally at a small hunting cabin near the compound itself.\n"
2718 "Cate is currently en route to Calcutta, where she will attempt to infiltrate H.A.R.M.'s Indian headquarters to learn more about Project: Omega.\n\nA UNITY intercept team is already on site to gather intelligence to facilitate her mission. They will need to locate and photograph a known H.A.R.M. employee by the name of Balaji Malpani.\n"
2719 "Cate has radioed in with disturbing news. Magnus Armstrong is trapped in Antarctica with H.A.R.M. reinforcements closing in and some sort of indestructible super soldier on the loose.\n\nA UNITY intercept team is being sent in to rescue Armstrong and demolish the site to prevent further work on Project: Omega.\n"
2720 "Shortly after Cate fought off a devastating attack on UNITY headquarters by a pack of machinegun-toting mimes, she departs on a mission to rescue Armstrong from the clutches of H.A.R.M.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems the mime infestation wasn't completely addressed. The assassins have launched a new attack, apparently determined to inflict as much damage as possible on UNITY.\n\nWith Cate gone, it will be up to a lone intercept team to deal with the crisis.\n"
2721 "During a dangerous mission deep inside the Soviet Union, Cate receives orders to sabotage a communications relay tower at a remote Siberian outpost. Her first goal is to procure the explosives she'll need to carry out her mission. Then it's just a matter of setting the charge at the base of the tower and getting out of the area before reinforcements arrive.\n\nTips: Just because you're spotted doesn't mean you have to fight. You can often evade pursuers and hide from them until they give up. Also, be sure to search filing cabinets, desk drawers, and neutralized enemies for valuable information and useful items."
2722 "Demo Mission Briefing UNITY"
2723 "Cate has come to Akron, Ohio, in search of clues relating to Project: Omega, an enigmatic Soviet plot that threatens to bring about World War III.\n\nWhen her mission takes a sudden turn for the unexpected, she finds herself in a trailer park with ninja assassins all around and a tornado closing in. Her only hope of escape is to defeat the ninjas and their mysterious leader, Isako, before she ends up somewhere over the rainbow or six feet deep."
2724 "This level demonstrates the LithTech Jupiter System's new water support as well as the use of decals."
2725 "This level showcases a few of the new characters from No One Lives Forever 2."
2750 "Cate travels to Japan to investigate a rumored international crime convention."
2751 "Cate must infiltrate the estate of The Director and photograph him."
2752 "Cate heads for Siberia to investigate Project: Omega. Her first task is to prepare for her escape."

2754 "Her mission complete, Cate must escape the compound alive."
2755 "Cate goes to Akron, Ohio to search for clues in the house of Melvin Blitzny."

3100 "Tip: You can use the space bar to skip movie sequences, although it is recommended that you watch each movie the first time it plays. Note that you can turn Load Screen tips off in the Options - Game menu."
3101 "Tip: If you're not sure what to do next, check the Mission screen (default hotkey: Tab) to see your objectives. Also, the compass in the upper right of your screen often indicates important destinations."
3102 "Tip: You can usually run and hide instead of fighting. Enemies can lose track of you at intersections if they didn't see which way you went. You can also escape by finding a Hiding Place."
3103 "Tip: Always search bodies for valuable items. You must hold down the Action button until the progress bar disappears in order to collect everything an enemy is carrying."
3104 "Tip: Be sure to spend your Skill Points to improve your abilities. Keep in mind that you can earn extra skill points by accomplishing optional objectives or finding intelligence items and Spy Training Manuals."
3105 "Tip: If you find the game too difficult or not challenging enough, adjust the difficulty setting in the Options menu. You might also reevaluate your tactics if you're charging headlong into combat."
3106 "Tip: You may occasionally have to obtain special items to accomplish an objective. Consult the Inventory screen (default hotkey: N) to see items you're carrying and examine them for clues."
3107 "Tip: Shooting a Tracking Device at an enemy will mark his or her position on your radar, making it easier for you to time your movements and to elude pursuers."
3108 "Tip: Some weapons accommodate multiple varieties of ammunition. Use the Change Ammo key (default: F) to cycle through available ammo types or consult the Equipment screen (default: M)."
3109 "Tip: Use the Intelligence screen (default: I) to examine any maps you've collected. By studying landmarks and using your compass, you should be able to figure out where you are and where you need to go."
3110 "Tip: Enemies will become alarmed when they see unconscious or dead allies lying around. You can move bodies out of the way using the Move Body key (default: G)."
3111 "Tip: Security cameras trigger alarms if they spot you or a body. Shooting a security camera will also set off an alarm, but you can find special camera disabling ammunition for the CT-180 Utility Launcher."

3113 "Tip: The Last Weapon key (default: X) is a convenient means of quickly switching between stealth-oriented weapons and those that provide stronger firepower."
3114 "Tip: Eavesdropping on enemies sometimes provides useful information. Also, enemies will often wander off to other tasks after a conversation, making it easier for you to proceed."
3115 "Tip: The crosshair provides useful feedback on weapon accuracy. The blurrier it becomes, the wilder your shots. Steady your aim by standing still. Sneaking perturbs your aim less than running."
3116 "Tip: Intentionally creating a disturbance can be an excellent way to lure unsuspecting guards out of your way. Be on the lookout for coins or other interactive items."
3117 "Tip: You will not actually throw a grenade until you release the Fire button. Grenades explode three seconds after you throw them unless they impact a target, in which case they detonate immediately."
3118 "Tip: A snowmobile will afford moderate protection against enemy fire in an arc in front of you, so it is therefore advisable to charge targets directly instead of circling them and exposing your back."
3119 "Tip: To defuse an explosive, simply target it and hold down the Action button until the progress bar runs down. The more skilled you are with gadgets, the more rapidly you can neutralize the device."

3121 "Tip: When you are able to interact with an object, text will appear just below the cursor describing what will happen when you press the Action button."
3122 "Tip: Body armor absorbs damage very effectively. Without it, weapons inflict a greater amount of damage. If you run out of armor, it may be advisable to play more cautiously until you find more."
3123 "Tip: When you are fighting a major villain, a meter will appear at the top of the screen to indicate how much damage you must inflict to achieve victory."
3124 "Tip: Save your progress often! Use the Quicksave key (F6) or the Save Game option in the System menu. Also keep in mind that the game Autosaves your progress at the beginning of each scene."
3125 "Tip: Sometimes it's more advisable to run away than to fight. Consider your objectives when you find yourself facing daunting odds."
3126 "Tip: If you find yourself backed into a corner and unable to fight back, rely on your trusty banana to slip past."
3127 "Tip: Use the Lean keys (defaults: Q and E) to see around corners without exposing yourself to danger. Enemies will eventually notice you, so only peek for a few seconds at a time."

3129 "Tip: Explore your surroundings carefully to find bonus objectives and useful items and equipment."

3137 "Tip: Head shots inflict greater damage than shots to the torso or limbs. Enemies are also easier to dispatch when they aren't alert."
3138 "Tip: The CT-180 Utility Launcher can be equipped with multiple ammunition types, including camera disablers, tranquilizer darts, and electrical devices."
3139 "Tip: Try to dispatch enemies quietly to avoid alerting other adversaries. Enemies that are suspicious or alarmed will cry out in pain, causing a disturbance."
3140 "Tip: After clearing an area, it is possible to bring additional enemies to your position by activating alarm switches. If you are low on health, armor, or ammunition, you may want to set traps for reinforcements and loot them."

10119 "Thank you, Dr. Schenker."
10120 "Mr. Lawrie, Ms. Archer, allow me to get straight to the point. "
10121 "By all means."
10122 "Are you familiar with the island of Khios?"
10123 "In the Sea of Marmara. Indeed. It's highly coveted by all the major powers."
10124 "Do you know why?"
10125 "Something to do with its natural resources, isn't it?"
10126 "Good Lord."
10127 "Precisely. We've reason to believe the Soviets are planning to invade Khios within the next two weeks."
10128 "The second them Reds set foot on that island, Uncle Sam's got a Polaris-shaped surprise package waiting to be signed, sealed, and delivered right to Moscow."
10129 "As the general suggests, the consequences of an invasion could be catastrophic. A full scale nuclear conflict is a distinct possibility."
10130 "But Khios is virtually impregnable to a conventional assault. How are they planning to invade?"
10131 "We're hoping you can find out. All we know is that it involves a secret weapon program known as Project: Omega."
10132 "We shoulda force-fed them Commies a nuke-u-ler sandwich back in '62."
10133 "Will you help us?"
10134 "Of course we will."
10135 "According to our spies, the Soviets are coordinating this project from an out of the way base in Siberia. We need to know what we're dealing with and we think the answer is somewhere inside that facility."
10136 "Uh oh. I forgot keys."
10137 "Maybe you can open door."
10138 "Hurry before we freeze."

10168 "Me too. I hate this place."
10169 "I thought my wife's cooking was bad. She's a gourmet chef compared to whoever's running the kitchen around here."
10170 "Too bad, boys. We ain't leaving any time soon."
10171 "I should've taken that assignment in Cairo. At least it would've been warm."
10172 "You didn't hear? Somebody blew up the Cairo headquarters."
10173 "Who?"
10174 "Hard to say. Everybody's claiming responsibility. Probably Fine Feathered Fiends, but it could have been Anger Mismanagement or Pretty Poison."
10175 "Guess I made the right choice after all. At least there's plenty of vodka."
10177 "Vodka keeps me warm."
10178 "Make me coffee. I'll be fine."
10179 "I'll drink coffee. You secure plane."
10180 "Go on. I'll be there soon."
10181 "Good coffee."
10182 "Sorry."
10183 "That makes 14, Mr. Volkov. Do you feel better yet?"
10184 "A little. Let's do one more."
10185 "Bring in Laramie!"
10186 "Please, don't do this! I beg you!"
10187 "Feed him into the machine."
10188 "I'm still upset."
10189 "Bring in Mackenzie!"
10190 "Mother, we've been over this a thousand times. I'm NOT coming home for Christmas."
10191 "You want to kill me like you killed your father."
10192 "Mummy, Daddy died of dysentery in Kenya."
10193 "He died of a broken heart because you never amounted to anything. When I think of the sacrifices we made."
10194 "Goodbye, Mother."
10195 "Don't you hang up on me."
10196 "Marvin? Be a good chap and fetch me a little drinkie-pooh, would you?"
10197 "Mr. Volkov was disappointed to learn that Cate Archer is still alive."
10198 "Then let him kill her."
10199 "Don't be impertinent."
10200 "She's not my enemy."
10201 "She's my enemy. And you're my retainer. Or have you forgotten who saved your life all those years ago?"
10202 "Don't tell me you're afraid of her."
10203 "I fear no one."
10204 "Then kill her.  And bring back proof this time."
10205 "Her head on a platter should suffice."
10206 "We were hoping for something a little more conclusive.  What do you know about this H.A.R.M. organization?"
10207 "We've had dealings with them before. They were barely competent at the time. Rumor has it they've restructured the organization since then, but nobody's quite sure what that means exactly."
10208 "Means you didn't kick their butts hard enough."
10209 "If nothing else, we've established that Project: Omega is H.A.R.M.'s brainchild, even if we still don't know exactly what it is."
10210 "That proposal we found was dated 1965."
10211 "And?"
10212 "That means it was well underway during the H.A.R.M. incident last year."
10213 "We've already scoured the North American facility where they were keeping Doctor Schenker. There's no mention of Project: Omega in the files we recovered. Sadly, the Alpine facility was completely demolished."
10214 "There's one other place I can think to look."
10215 "Where?"
10216 "Akron, Ohio."
10217 "We've searched Goodman's house."
10218 "Blitzny."
10219 "Pardon?"
10220 "His name was Melvin Blitzny. Tom Goodman died in Amsterdam, remember?"
10221 "Regardless, our teams have been through the place thoroughly."
10222 "I haven't."
10223 "This is a waste of time."
10224 "We'll see."
10225 "Well, be careful."
10228 "I'll bring you a souvenir."
10229 "Please don't."
10232 "Can we postpone this?"
10233 "Fine."
10234 "You're very determined."
10235 "I made a promise."
10236 "Bye bye!"
10238 "Ah, good, you're awake."
10239 "I feel dizzy."
10240 "Nothing a week's worth of rest won't clear up."
10245 "I don't have time for that. I have to find Armstrong."
10246 "I must insist!"
10247 "Come on, ya jessies. You ain't even trying!"
10248 "Oh, hello, Cate."
10249 "Armstrong."
10250 "How'd you find me?  Oh, that's right, you're a spy."
10251 "Having a tough go of it?"
10252 "Well, it's eleven against one. Excuse me a moment."
10253 "That's the spirit, lads!"
10254 "Make that twelve. I didn't see the one in the corner. I won't be a minute."
10255 "Take your time."
10256 "Now I'm mad."
10257 "Right. Now what can I do for you?"
10258 "I need your help."
10259 "I don't know. I've pretty much washed my hands of international intrigue."
10261 "You owe me."
10262 "Ah, don't start."
10263 "All we're asking is that you help Cate infiltrate the India branch."
10264 "You don't need me for that. "
10265 "A lot's changed since you left H.A.R.M. Security's tighter than ever."
10266 "Well, I suppose I could make a few calls, but don't expect me to get involved."
10267 "Kamal, Magnus.  I'm coming to India."
10298 "I have an appointment with Monsieur Volkov."
10299 "Excuse me?"
10300 "I was sent for by Dmitrij Volkov."
10301 "I'm sorry, can you speak up?"
10302 "Take me to Volkov. Now."
10303 "Please follow me."
10304 "Oh, molten lava! Very nice."
10305 "Wait here, please."
10306 "Sir, the assassin has arrived."
10307 "Send him in."
10308 "I just want to say, Monsieur, that it is an honor to stand in the presence of the legendary Dmitrij Volkov. You are, without a doubt, the Michelangelo of murder."
10309 "Well, that's very kind of you."
10312 "Monsieur Volkov, tell me who did this to you and I shall exact terrible vengeance."
10313 "It was a skiing accident."
10314 "Oh, I see."
10315 "Now then. You're probably wondering why I've summoned one of the world's most dangerous contract killers on such short notice."
10316 "Because you want me to kill someone?"
10317 "Not just someone.  I want you to kill Cate Archer."
10318 "How do I convince them to hire me?"
10319 "Demonstrate your value to them. Maybe they need a maid."
10320 "We're being watched."
10321 "Right. I'll stay here. You grab him and find out what he's after."
10322 "My pleasure."
10323 "Careful."
10324 "Who are you?"
10325 "Kamal sent me to meet you."
10326 "Why didn't you introduce yourself?"
10327 "I thought I was being followed."
10328 "Kamal is waiting for you at the... gasp."
10329 "I said grab him, not stab him."
10330 "He was about to tell me where to meet Kamal."
10331 "Not a problem. Kamal said he'd wear a pink carnation so you'd recognize him."
10332 "Me?"
10333 "I can't afford to be seen."
10334 "You there!"
10335 "I'll handle this. You look for Kamal."
10336 "How will I find you?"
10337 "It's not like I blend in."
10340 "Tell us where he is!"
10341 "I'll never talk!"
10342 "Then you'll die!!!"
10343 "Look out!"
10344 "Ah, there you are! I was beginning to worry."
10345 "This map shows the location H.A.R.M.'s hideout. I left a package for you in a newspaper box near there."
10346 "Oh, before I forget, you'll probably need some money to get by Crazy Harij. Fifty rupees should be enough."
10347 "You want through? Fifty rupees."
10348 "No one passes without paying Harij."
10349 "Don't make Harij angry."
10350 "I've told you MANY times: fifty rupees if you want through this gate."
10351 "You may pass."
10352 "If I catch you charging tolls again, I'll arrest you. I swear it."
10353 "It's my gate."
10354 "No! No! It's NOT your gate. I'm warning you!"
10355 "Now get out of my sight."
10356 "Hello?"
10357 "Hello?"
10358 "Who is this I'm speaking to?"
10359 "Who is this I'M speaking to?"
10360 "It is I, Balaji Malpani."
10361 "Balaji, you idiot, it's me, Anoop."
10362 "Oh! I was wondering if that was you, my good friend. How are you?"
10363 "Fine, thank you. So, what is the password for today? Have you thought of something?"
10364 "I have! And I think you'll like it very much!"
10365 "Don't keep me in suspense."
10366 "Okay. The password for the day is... Are you ready?"
10367 "Spit it out, monkey brains!"
10368 "Mulligatawny. What do you think?"
10369 "I think I should feed you to ferocious weasels."
10370 "Password?"
10371 "Get out of here."
10372 "I don't know what you're talking about."
10373 "The chief of security. Where can I find him?"
10374 "We don't have a chief of security."
10375 "Isn't this H.A.R.M.'s Indian headquarters office?"
10376 "What is H.A.R.M.?"
10377 "Supposing this were H.A.R.M. and you did have a security chief named Anoop Banerjee, where would I find him?"
10378 "Down the hall. His office is on the second floor."
10379 "Thank you."
10380 "My pleasure."
10381 "Wait a second!"
10382 "You don't have clearance to leave this building. I'll tell Banerjee you want to see him."
10384 "Now's your chance, Cate. Get into Banerjee's office and plant a bug on his phone. Don't get caught!"
10385 "Jolly good! Now find the junction box. According to Intelligence, it's somewhere on the first floor."
10386 "Ambushed?"
10387 "It was those Evil Alliance bastards."
10388 "We lost the whole shipment?"
10389 "Pacpac managed to save two cases of Sparkle Soda, but they got all the ice cream and candy."
10390 "Curse them! They've pushed us too far this time. Return to base immediately. We must prepare."
10391 "Prem? Bring the girl to my office. I will see her now."
10392 "Follow me, please."
10393 "Through this door, please."
10401 "Mr. Banerjee is waiting."
10402 "Mr. Banerjee is a busy man. Please don't waste his time."
10403 "Where do you think you're going?"
10404 "If you do not want to speak to Mr. Banerjee, you must leave."
10405 "I'm warning you. This is your last chance."
10406 "Very well. You obviously don't want to speak to him. Get out or I'll throw you out!"
10407 "Where is the young lady?"
10408 "I believe she's in the restroom."
10409 "Excuse me, miss? The boss will see you now."
10410 "Hello?"
10411 "Are you okay in there?"
10412 "I'm beginning to grow concerned about you."
10413 "Please come out or I shall break down the door."
10414 "One, two, three!"
10415 "Guards! Don't let her get away!"
10416 "Even if I did work for this H.A.R.M. company, how could I be guaranteed of your qualifications?"
10417 "I'm told that Evil Alliance has an office in the area."
10418 "I wouldn't know. But, please, go on."
10419 "Well, what if I were to bring you the contents of their safe and wreck their operation?"
10420 "Let's just say that if I were responsible for hiring people for an organization like the one you describe, I would be very impressed by such a bold display."
10421 "I'll be right back."
10444 "You're drunk!"
10445 "I got bored."
10446 "Some help you are."
10447 "Girlie, I don't need a lecture. I'm a big boy. Besides, to be perfectly honest, there's not that much difference between me drunk and me sober."
10448 "Well, I think I've got the job."
10449 "That's a good start, but not good enough. From what Kamal tells me, you'll need a higher security clearance if you want to get near that safe."
10450 "I guess I'll have to get myself promoted."
10451 "Impressed?"
10452 "You're hired. It's an entry level position, but I think you'll find the salary and benefits very competitive. Welcome to H.A.R.M."
10462 "That is Kali."
10463 "You startled me. She's quite intimidating, isn't she?"
10464 "Kali is a paradox. Protector and destroyer. She nearly demolished the world in her attempt to save it."
10465 "Isn't that always the case. What happened?"
10466 "There was a demon general called Raktabija, whose every drop of blood, when shed upon the ground, would birth a new Raktabija... until the battlefield was covered with them. In their despair, the gods called upon Parvati, consort of Lord Shiva. Taking the form of Kali, she rode into battle, spreading out her tongue to catch the demon's blood before it could touch the soil and spawn new armies. But she became drunk on his blood and her victory dance threatened to tear the world apart, until Lord Shiva threw himself beneath her feet and the sight of him calmed her."
10467 "Fascinating."
10468 "And not unlike my wife. Except that she would continue dancing."
10469 "You poor dear."
10470 "You should wash your hands with hot water."
10471 "I suggest you wash your hands with hot water."
10472 "There is a lavatory through those doors and to the right."
10473 "As I said, you should wash your hands. Use hot water."
10481 "Cate Archer?"
10482 "Hey, everyone! It's Cate Archer! British superspy!"
10483 "Can I have your autograph?"
10484 "Get to the street! Armstrong is waiting for you!"
10485 "Go!"
10486 "Hurry!"
10487 "There's not much time!"
10488 "I'm serious!"
10489 "Why are you testing my patience?"
10492 "What the hell?"
10493 "We're trapped!"
10494 "Hey, you, give us a hand, willya?"
10495 "I expected more of a challenge."
10496 "What are you jabbering about?"
10497 "So this is the mighty Cate Archer? I'm not impressed."
10498 "When I get out of here, I'm gonna pound that pasty face of yours through the nearest wall."
10499 "It's a long way down, mon ami. The only way you'll get out of that cage is to leak out like onion soup."
10500 "Oui? Okay, sounds like Fred Astaire?  Bicycle?  Pony? "
10501 "Mon dieu! Just tell me!"
10502 "Sir, come quickly! We have a problem outside!"
10503 "I don't wanna die."
10504 "What are you doing?"
10505 "Good girl!"
10506 "Ha!"
10507 "No good. The door's barred from the other side."
10508 "Stand back. I'm gonna ram it."
10509 "Not exactly what I had in mind."
10510 "You're gonna have to get this door open, lassie."
10511 "Let me out of here!"
10512 "Open this door!"
10513 "Oy!"
10514 "Open up, I say!"
10515 "Cover me!"
10516 "I said cover me!"
10517 "Why am I getting shot at?"
10518 "They're mine. You can't have them."
10519 "The girl must be punished!"
10520 "I'm seeing to it personally."
10521 "Damn you!"
10522 "Now if you'll excuse me."
10523 "I'll report this to the Director."
10524 "I'll report this to the Director."
10525 "Make sure he leaves."
10526 "Now!"
10527 "Not so fast, Frenchie."
10528 "Merde!"
10529 "Hurry! I'll drive, you shoot!"
10530 "You won't be so lucky next time."
10534 "Aunt Phyllis tells me you still haven't called her. The woman is lying on her deathbed and you can't be bothered to make a telephone call."
10535 "Mother, Aunt Phyllis used to keep me locked in the cellar whenever you sent me to stay with her."
10536 "If I'd known what an ingrate you'd turn out to be, I would have locked you in the cellar too! I swear, if your father..."
10537 "Goodbye, Mummy. Lovely to hear your voice."
10538 "Don't you hang up on me."
10539 "Are the preparations complete?"
10540 "Yes, sir. The division is currently en route to the test area."
10541 "Good. We'll kill two birds with one stone.  Is there something else?"
10542 "There has been a slight complication."
10543 "We're running out of time."
10544 "Finally some good news for a change. All this diplomacy crap's giving me a headache."
10545 "Our agents are closing in as we speak."
10546 "I hope so."
10547 "You really impressed me back there."
10548 "Listen to you cry."
10549 "All you had to do was grab him, you dumb ox."
10550 "Cry, cry, cry."
10551 "Well, at least you got his coat. Maybe he'll freeze to death."
10552 "Boo hoo."
10553 "Shut up."
10554 "Make me."
10555 "Excuse me. Agent Archer, the site should be just beyond that ridge ahead."
10556 "What's that smoke?"
10557 "Something's wrong."
10558 "I didn't realize I was in the company of a genius."
10559 "I've kicked your arse before; I can do it again."
10560 "When did you become such a bully?"
10561 "Wait here. I'll have a look around."
10562 "I hope you don't break a nail."
10563 "Do you want to wait in the plane?"
10564 "Here, I'll give you a boost."
10565 "I'll wait here then."
10566 "You have to stop him. He's out of control."
10576 "Who... who are you?"
10577 "We're all going to die!"
10578 "This way! Hurry!"
10579 "Poor Hotchkins. He tried to warn them."
10580 "The other subjects were fine, but that one... that one was different."
10581 "Willpower. That's what it was. We should have increased its chemical treatments."
10582 "Poor, poor Hotchkins."
10583 "What's going on over there?"
10584 "Can you get through?"
10585 "Oh, there you are."
10592 "You're not making any sense."
10593 "H.A.R.M.'s planning a field test! They're going to use the super soldiers to destroy their Indian headquarters! As punishment!"
10594 "When?"
10595 "It may have already started. I'm on my way there. Alert the police and tell them not to try to fight back. Just evacuate the area."
10596 "All right! But be careful!"
10597 "No, please!"
10598 "Are you Cate Archer?"
10599 "Yes. What's the situation?"
10600 "We're still evacuating the area"
10601 "If your men can keep the soldiers busy, I'll see about getting those people out of there."
10602 "Ms. Archer! This way!"
10603 "Kamal!"
10604 "I have information for you!"
10605 "Ms. Archer. Are you okay?"
10606 "I guess so. What about you? Are you all right?"
10607 "I think I'm out of a job."
10608 "Ms. Archer, I'm glad you came back. I have news about Magnus Armstrong."
10609 "What is it? Is he all right?"
10610 "He's in the custody of H.A.R.M."
10611 "Not for long."
10621 "Is this the information on the super soldiers?"
10622 "Everything I could find."
10623 "Oh dear."
10624 "Your glasses? Again?"
10625 "I think I left them in the cafeteria."
10626 "I'll be right back."
10627 "As you can see from this diagram, I've got it all figured out. You give me twelve hours, I'll give you Mother Russia."
10628 "Not a very detailed plan of attack."
10629 "We can work out the details later. The first thing is to get El Presidente to sign off on the idea."
10630 "Let me know what he says."
10631 "Hello, Agent Archer."
10632 "General Hawkins was just explaining his plan for invading Russia."
10633 "Of course, he left out the part where he describes what actually happens during the invasion."
10634 "Too bad his zeal isn't matched by his intelligence."
10635 "Sigh."
10636 "I don't know about you Brits, but us Americans ain't gonna sit on our muffins waiting for the bomb to fall."
10637 "I'd describe how the plan works, but it's kinda technical. It'd go right over your purty little head."
10638 "Why don't you stick to swapping recipes and leave the thinking to us."
10639 "On second thought, why don't you and me ditch this joint and discuss this stuff in private. If you know what I mean?"
10640 "Attention, all personnel! Intruders have been spotted near the cafeteria area. They are believed to be armed and extremely dangerous!"
10641 "I've just been told that the intruders appear to be mimes."
10642 "All personnel, stand down from alert. The threat has been neutralized. Thank you."
10644 "There you are! I was worried you'd been kidnapped."
10645 "Ah, you found them."
10646 "Sorry to alarm you. Some strange small person popped into my office and I thought it best to run away."
10647 "Commendable plan."
10648 "Let's take a look at those files, shall we?"
10649 "Must you fidget?"
10650 "Yes."
10651 "I should think I can come up with something helpful. Of course, I'll need to analyze the data more thoroughly, so why don't you run along and blow something up for a while."
10652 "Good idea. I'll just..."
10653 "...pop out and rescue Armstrong."
10654 "Have fun."
10655 "Hmmm, Armstrong."
10656 "Whiskey, straight up."
10657 "Trouble at the office?"
10658 "Buncha damn girly men ain't willing to do what needs to be done. Ah, you don't wanna listen to my problems."
10659 "On the contrary. I'd love to."
10660 "What am I supposed to do? The dang thing just shorted out."
10661 "Do you have your warrantee card?"
10662 "What do you think THIS is, toilet paper? Although it might as well be."
10663 "Did you read the part where it says the manufacturer isn't liable in the event of owner neglect or misuse?"
10664 "Misuse? I was just following the damn instructions."
10665 "The card clearly indicates the conditions under which the warrantee will be voided. There's a whole list of things that can cause malfunctions."
10666 "I give up! Those robots are useless anyway."
10667 "See this? This is what I think of these idiot robots."
10668 "What are you looking at?"
10669 "Error. Does not compute. Please consult User Manual for correct input procedure."

10673 "Here's your Supercomputer Services Product Catalogue."
10674 "I'm sorry. The Supercomputer User Manual is currently checked out."
10675 "Since you're cute, I'm gonna help you out. Chris Hibbard has had the manual checked out for the past four months. He's terrible about bringing stuff back when he's done with it, but he always leaves stuff sitting on his desk. I even made a copy of his office pass card. You can borrow it, but please bring it back when you're done. I'd hate to have to sic security on you."

10680 "You made me wet myself!"
10681 "Sorry. Give me your pass card."
10682 "You're not authorized to enter the Supercomputer Services department."
10683 "I need the Supercomputer User Manual Supplement. It's not even listed in the catalogue. I don't have time for all this bureaucracy. Give me the pass card or else."
10684 "Fine."
10685 "I'll be damned."
10686 "Ah, don't act so surprised."
10687 "I can't say I was expecting to see you here."
10688 "You thought I'd leave you to die?"
10689 "Think you can get me out of this mess?"
10690 "Not a chance, but at least she can watch you die."
10691 "Hurry up, lass!"
10692 "Oh, golly."
10693 "Don't forget about me, now."
10694 "Cate!"
10695 "I'm about out of time here, girlie."
10696 "Well, I'll be."
10697 "Oh, no you don't."
10698 "Say goodbye to your little friend."
10699 "Curse you!"
10700 "That's another one I owe you."
10701 "Uh oh. Let's get out of here!"
10702 "Abigail!"
10703 "I can't control myself."
10704 "Aaarrrrrggggghhhhh!!!"
10705 "That doesn't sound good."
10706 "Right. One of us is gonna have to find the bilge pumps and drain corridor 4B."
10707 "Either head down that way or go wait over there."
10708 "I'm off, then."
10709 "I'll wait here, then."
10710 "See you soon."
10711 "Okay, I'm draining the corridor. Hold tight."
10712 "Go! I may need your help in a moment. Find an intercom console."
10713 "When you reach the pumps, drain corridor 4B."
10714 "Okay, it's working. Look for a way out of there."
10715 "Cate, I need your help. A security camera's shorting out. It'll zap me if I get too close. Find the security office... what the hell?"
10716 "Cate, is that you? Where are you now? I'm..."
10717 "What do you recommend, Peterson? That we just lie down and die?"
10718 "We've searched everywhere."
10719 "Well, keep searching. There's got to be some sort of mechanism somewhere."
10720 "Yes, sir."
10721 "Oh, golly."
10724 "Keep a low profile. I'll have a look around."
10725 "Fine with me. I stumbled on a wee bottle of brandy on the way here. I've been meaning to take her for a test drive."
10726 "Quit grumbling. We could have left you for dead."
10727 "Magnus, launch the escape pod."
10728 "Must be jammed."
10729 "Doesn't anything on this stupid base work the way it's supposed to?"
10730 "No."
10731 "Guess I'm staying after all."
10732 "What? That's crazy. I didn't come all this way to let you drown."
10733 "Got a better idea? I'm the only one strong enough for the job."
10734 "There'll be no arguing."
10735 "There must be some other way."
10736 "Not unless you want us all to die."
10737 "Wish me luck."
10738 "There he is!"
10739 "You can do it, Magnus."
10740 "You must call off this operation."
10741 "Call it off? Impossible."
10742 "It was never approved, only discussed."
10743 "Well, I suppose I could be convinced for 100 million pounds sterling."
10744 "You're mad."
10745 "Am I? Unless I'm mistaken, once my super soldiers seize Khios, it will be you facing the specter of annihilation."
10748 "You expect me to believe your super soldiers will accomplish what no nation on earth has ever done? Khios is impenetrable. Even to you."
10749 "I'll send you a postcard."
10750 "You leave me no choice but to contact our ambassador in Washington."
10751 "Be my guest. Let's see if they believe you."
10752 "Yes?"
10753 "Where have you been? I've been trying to reach you all morning."
10754 "Hello, Mother.  Goodbye, Mother."
10755 "Don't you dare hang up."
10756 "I just got off the phone with Washington. The Soviets are denying any involvement."
10757 "Lying bunch of whores."
10758 "Washington has warned them that a Soviet flag flying over the island of Khios will be considered an act of war."
10759 "I've completed my analysis."
10760 "So what's this?"
10761 "Anti-super soldier serum."
10762 "Perfect. What does it do?"
10763 "Do you want the technical answer?"
10764 "Explain it so Barnes will understand."
10765 "It causes a chemical reaction in the super soldiers that essentially boils their innards."
10766 "Well, hot damn."
10770 "I think we should presume she's failed."
10771 "We're running out of options."
10773 "Where do I sign up for this shindig?"
10774 "You'll be on your own. If we put our troops on that island, the Soviets will launch against us. We've warned the local authorities not to interfere, since their weapons would be useless. "
10775 "They could at least give the super soldiers some alternatives to shoot at."
10776 "Why didn't I think of that."
10777 "You got to use your head, sir."
10779 "I considered putting a bullet in your head while you were unconscious."
10780 "Why didn't you?"
10781 "Too easy. For you. After all the grief you've caused us, it's not enough simply to let you die in your sleep."
10782 "I hope you have something interesting in mind."
10784 "You've got to be kidding."
10785 "I thought that might get your attention."
10786 "You stole this idea from Masters of Mayhem."
10787 "Nonsense."
10788 "They've been murdering people like this since '63."
10789 "Start the mechanism."
10792 "Do it yourself."
10793 "Start the mechanism."
10795 "Damn thing!"
10796 "I thought I might run into you."
10797 "I knew I would run into you."
10798 "What do you say we pretend we didn't see each other."
10799 "I can't."
10800 "All right."
10801 "I was wrong to have spared your life all those years ago."
10802 "You've been nothing but a disappointment. Sayonara."
10803 "Damn it!"
10804 "Are you all right?"
10805 "Can't say much for your taste in employers."
10806 "He was like a father."
10807 "You're better off as an orphan."
10808 "I am in your debt."
10809 "Then will you please stop trying to kill me?"
10810 "What's wrong?"
10811 "Nothing is wrong."
10812 "Well, I'm late to a war. Sayonara."
10815 "Okay, Perkins, take us up."
10816 "Aye, aye, sir!"
10817 "All hands, prepare to deploy invasion force."
10818 "We're detecting an unidentified submarine near the coastline. They slipped through the blockade."
10819 "Attention, all personnel, we are at DefCon 2. Repeat, we are at DefCon 2."
10820 "You think the President would let me push the button?"
10821 "I'm surprised he lets you use a telephone."
10822 "President Johnson is about to address the American people."
10823 "My fellow Americans, it is my grave duty to inform you of a crisis unfolding in a far-off land many of us have never even heard of. Even as we continue to endeavor toward peace in Vietnam and a settlement to the continuing crisis in the Middle East, a dangerous new menace has cast its shadow over the tiny island nation of Khios in the Sea of Marmara, off the coast of Turkey. For decades now, we have lived with a constant, abiding fear of war against the Soviet Union."
10824 "God save us all."
10825 "All stop!"
10826 "Aye, aye, sir!"
10827 "Perfect! Begin deployment."
10828 "Cate!"
10829 "Well, I'll be damned."
10830 "What?!"
10831 "Damn that meddlesome girl."
10832 "Didn't think you'd make it."
10833 "Neither did I. Where's the ammunition?"
10834 "On its way. Bruno says they finished assembling the capsules. They'll be airdropping it to us any moment."
10835 "Good. We should be able to hold out as long as Doctor Schenker's Super Soldier tonic does what it's supposed to."
10836 "I have an idea. Stay here and make sure nobody gets near that flag."
10837 "It's too late, Archer."
10838 "Oh no."
10839 "God save us all."
10840 "Yee haw!"
10841 "One small misstep for man, one giant calamity for mankind. And I'll be sipping daiquiris on a beach in the South Pacific until it all blows over. Too bad mummy won't be joining me."
10842 "During the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, we came as close as any of us would ever hope to come. It is therefore with deep sadness and frustration that I must brace the American people for an equally dangerous standoff half a world away from the site of the last terrible confrontation. America has guaranteed the continued independence of Khios at any cost. Now we are being asked to stand behind that pledge. We cannot back down from it."
10844 "Ow."
10845 "We're in business!"
10846 "The flag!"
10847 "We have to stop that missile."
10848 "Too late, boys. She's out of range. Damn, I wish I had some popcorn for this."
10849 "What's that girl up to?"
10850 "The Soviets are promising to launch a full retaliatory strike unless the missile is destroyed."
10851 "This is getting better by the minute."
10852 "Oh, thank God."
10853 "Wait!"
10854 "What's wrong?"
10855 "Stay back."
10858 "Well, that's enough for me. I'm long overdue for a pint or two."
10859 "Ah, there you are. Anything interesting happen while I was away?"
10860 "Not particularly."
10861 "Well, I suppose you're probably eager for some excitement."
10862 "Not particularly."
10863 "Is everything all right?"
10864 "Not particularly."
10865 "You're a disgrace to this family."
10866 "Yes, Mother."
10867 "When your cousin Beauregard went to prison for arson, I thought that was as bad as it could ever get. Beauregard is a saint compared to you. "
10868 "Yes, Mother."
10869 "I hope you're proud."
10870 "Yes, Mother."
10871 "And another thing..."
10872 "I quit."
10873 "What do you mean, you quit? You can't quit."
10874 "Watch me."
10875 "Dmitrij?"
10876 "Dmitrij!"
10877 "The world hasn't heard the last of H.A.R.M.! You can either stand with us or against us."
10889 "This way! Come on!"
10890 "Follow me!"
10891 "Over here!"
10892 "Hurry!"
10893 "In here!"
10894 "Fat chance of that."
10895 "What was that?"
10896 "Forget about me. We're trying to stop a war, remember?"
10897 "Get out of here! I don't know how long I can hold on."
10899 "(Deep breath)"
10900 "We're picking up an inbound jet fighter. The pilot is giving the code Foxhunt."
10901 "Consider it done."
10902 "If I'm not back in an hour, clear out and contact headquarters."
10903 "Call it a hunch. Something about this assignment feels wrong."
10904 "Wish me luck."
10905 "Maybe you need your arse kicked."
10906 "We've got to get you out of here."
10907 "You don't want to know."
10908 "Let them come. We're not leaving without Armstrong."
10909 "We'll send help!"
10910 "Magnus."
10911 "And send an intercept team to the Antarctic facility. Armstrong is still there."
10912 "That's just great."
10913 "Insufferable woman."
10914 "So sorry I can't stay to see the fireworks. I really must be going. Ta ta."
10915 "Abigail!!!"
10916 "AAARRRRRGGGGHHHH!!! ABIGAIL!!!"
10917 "No, please!"
10918 "I'll wait for you here."
10919 "It's not like you to be cynical."
10920 "No, please!"
10921 "Look!"
10922 "We must go. Bad guys are coming. Many helicopters."
10923 "We should hurry."
10924 "No, please!"
10925 "No, please!"
11001 "Hatori-san is waiting for you somewhere in the village."
11002 "Look for messages from him."
11003 "Find Hatori-san. He can help you with your mission."
11004 "Good luck!"
11005 "Psst."
11006 "Caw, caw!"
11007 "Over here!"
11008 "It's me, Santa!"
11009 "Say hello to the Mark VII Mechanized Mynah Bird. Perfect way for me to communicate with you in the field."
11010 "Now, then, anything I can do for you?"
11011 "If you're unsure what to do next, consult the Mission Status screen. "
11012 "Unless an objective is marked optional, you must accomplish it in order to complete your mission."
11013 "On certain missions you may also receive parameters, which are general guidelines or rules of conduct. Violate them at your own risk."
11014 "That covers the basics."
11015 "Anything else?"
11016 "The Equipment screen shows you a complete list of the weapons and gadgets you're carrying. Choosing an item from this list will bring up a detailed description and a summary of available ammunition types or gadget functions, which can also be selected here."
11017 "Jolly good. I'll be in touch soon."
11018 "Careful!"
11019 "You can lean around corners to see what's up ahead."
11020 "Enemies will eventually notice you, though, so don't peek too long."
11021 "Enemies can hear any sound you make, so learn to move quietly."
11022 "Your footsteps can give you away, but you can Sneak to tread softly."
11023 "Keep in mind that certain materials, such as ceramic tile, magnify sound, whereas surfaces like grass or snow will dampen your footfalls."
11024 "Also, be careful not to knock over bottles or bump into wind chimes or you'll cause a disturbance."
11025 "Try to dispatch enemies when they're unsuspecting. If they see you, they'll cry out, attracting attention."
11026 "Also, don't leave bodies lying around. Move them somewhere out of the way."
11027 "When you overcome certain obstacles or accomplish specific objectives, you'll receive skill point rewards."
11028 "Bring up the Player screen to spend these points to improve your abilities."
11029 "I'm hungry."
11030 "You just ate."
11031 "I can't help it. I eat when I'm stressed."
11032 "Why are you stressed?"
11033 "I have a bad feeling about tonight."
11034 "You're worried about one little spy?"
11035 "What? No, Kenji-san asked me to meet him later. I think he wants to break up."
11036 "My grandmother said you should poison your man every morning before he leaves. Tell him he can have the antidote when he comes home."
11037 "What poison should I use?"
11038 "I'm sure my grandmother can give you something. She doesn't need it anymore."
11039 "She's not worried about your grandfather running away?"
11040 "He can't. He's paralyzed. You have to be very careful with the dosage."
11041 "Do you want to go shopping in Nagoya this weekend?"
11042 "I can't. I have an assassination."
11043 "Get Haruko to do it."
11044 "She's still mad at me about her cat."
11045 "What about Yuki?"
11046 "I'll ask her."
11047 "Let me know."
11049 "Notice the Hiding Place icon in the bottom corner of your screen? This indicates you have entered a potential hiding place. In order to become truly hidden, you must stand still until the Hidden icon shows. Once you are hidden, enemies will not be able to see you unless they are investigating a disturbance or actively searching the area."
11050 "You are only hidden when standing still. If you move, attack, or reload a weapon, you will become unhidden."
11053 "What happened to your arm?"
11054 "I got in a fight with my mom."
11055 "Looks like she cut you pretty badly."
11056 "She caught me by surprise. She's fast for her age."
11057 "She must have been really mad."
11058 "She thinks we don't dress properly for ninjas. I'm like, Mom, it's the '60s. Get used to it. And she's like, It's disrespectful. So I said, old people always say that."
11059 "Uh oh."
11060 "Yeah, she went kind of crazy. She came flying across the room and started slashing at me. Finally I fought her off, but I was worried I was going to accidentally stab her. That would have made her really mad."
11061 "You better buy her some chocolates or something."
11062 "Good idea."
11063 "Agent Archer, over here!"
11064 "I have bad news. They've moved the meeting. You'll have to find out where."
11065 "Look for places where ninjas are gathered together."
11066 "Maybe you can hear them talking about the new location."
11067 "You might be able to find a memo, but that's risky."
11068 "Be careful!"
11069 "Why are they moving the meeting to the main house?"
11070 "Isako-san says the Director wants it there."
11071 "He's probably too drunk to walk to the guest house."
11072 "No, he'd just call for his palanquin."
11073 "I hate working for him."
11074 "We all do, but Isako-san owes him a debt of honor."
11075 "Good work! I'll mark the location of the meeting on this map."
11076 "Okay, follow me!"
11077 "The patrols are heavier in this part of town."
11078 "It's safer to avoid them."
11079 "Avoid the main gate. Too many guards."
11080 "Good luck."
11081 "Any trouble?"
11082 "It's been very quiet."
11083 "Good. "
11084 "The spy has been spotted."
11085 "Stay alert."
11086 "I noticed she's been gaining a lot of weight recently."
11087 "All she does is sit around eating mochi and watching detective shows."
11088 "She needs to find a man to take care of her."
11089 "No one wants her. She's too shy. Maybe if she was prettier, but she can't even talk to men."
11090 "What about Kenichi's son? He's a little slow, but he's still nice looking."
11091 "She'd never agree. She's too picky."
11092 "What's wrong with her?"
11093 "What time is it?"
11094 "I don't know. Why?"
11095 "I'm supposed to relieve Masayo-san at 8:00. You don't have a watch?"
11096 "I don't need one. Ninjas can tell time by the slit of a cat's eye."
11097 "That only works during daylight. Besides, what happens if you don't have a cat handy?"
11098 "That's why I always carry dried fish."
11099 "Isn't easier just to wear a watch? Never mind. I'll go ask somebody else."
11100 "It's such a nice evening. Too bad we have to work."
11101 "It'll probably be raining this weekend."
11102 "Want some tea?"
11103 "I'm supposed to go on patrol soon. If I drink tea, I'll have to pee fifteen minutes later."
11104 "So?"
11105 "I got in trouble last week. It's not worth it."
11106 "Find her!"
11107 "Quickly!"
11108 "Don't let her escape!"
11109 "Search everywhere!"
11110 "If she gets away, we're in big trouble!"
11111 "She may come this way. Make sure she doesn't get by you!"
11112 "Hai!"
11113 "Cate, I've dispatched an intercept team to assist you, but it may take some time for them to reach the rendezvous point. Get back to the bridge and try to avoid being seen."
11114 "Have they found her?"
11115 "Not yet. Be careful!"
11116 "Do you have a paper clip?"
11117 "We're all out."
11118 "Have you requisitioned more?"
11119 "Of course not."
11120 "What do you mean? Why not?"
11121 "Do you know how many forms you have to fill out to request office materials? It's worse than lavatory supplies. We don't need paper clips."
11122 "And when you run out of staples?"
11123 "I can live without staples."
11124 "You disgust me."
11125 "It's colder than yesterday."
11126 "Just think, if we conquer America, Florida will be part of the Soviet Union. "
11127 "Last year for holiday they sent me to Murmansk."
11128 "At least I got Minsk."
11129 "I dream of being sent to Minsk. I don't remember what it's like to go to bed without wearing a jacket."
11130 "Did you send in that security report yet?"
11131 "Yesterday, why?"
11132 "I forgot to fill it out."
11133 "What do you mean?"
11134 "I didn't fill it out."
11135 "Then why did you ask me to send it?"
11136 "I'm not sure. I didn't even think about it."
11137 "Well, I doubt anyone will notice. They don't read those things anyway. If they complain, we'll just resubmit."
11138 "You misunderstand me, Comrade. My point is that the State IS the People. When you abuse the People, you abuse the State."
11139 "But the State abuses the People all the time. What do you call that, masochism?"
11140 "The State doesn't ABUSE the People, it GUIDES them."
11141 "My grandfather died at the hands of the Cheka. He was put in a barrel with rats. The 18 year old torturer who came up with the idea heated the barrel until the rats clawed their way inside my grandfather's body to escape the heat. Do you call that guidance?"
11142 "Disciplinary measures are sometimes necessary to preserve the sanctity of the State. If an ugly tumor grows on your nose, you cut it off to protect your body."
11143 "My grandfather was a peasant. He died because he was afraid of collectivization."
11144 "The People must learn to trust the State."
11145 "I thought you said the People ARE the State."
11146 "Yes, which means they must learn to trust themselves."
11147 "My grandfather DID trust himself. That's why the State tortured and killed him."
11148 "I can see that your patriotism is in question, Comrade. Perhaps you should consider a visit to the Attitude Adjustment Center in Prague."
11149 "Those two are at it again."
11150 "Sergei never gives up, does he?"
11151 "He's young and idealistic. Give him time."
11152 "This is Kominsky. We found a suspicious person at the old dacha by the lake. We're bringing him in for interrogation."
11153 "What were you doing there?"
11154 "Vacation."
11155 "You must take me for a fool. No one would come to this place for vacation."
11156 "I come for hunting."
11157 "Admit it, you're a spy."
11158 "Why would I come here to spy?"
11159 "Because you know that a top secret project is being worked on at this base."
11160 "It is?"
11161 "Igor."
11162 "What?"
11163 "You just told him about the project."
11164 "He tricked me!"
11165 "How did I trick you?"
11166 "You got me to tell you about Project: Omega."
11167 "Project: Omega?"
11168 "Igor, you fool!"
11169 "Damn it. This prisoner is too devious. We'd better torture him."
11170 "Thank you for helping me."
11171 "I'm going to sample their vodka before I go back."
11172 "I'll see you later."
11173 "Don't you have work to do?"
11174 "Complete mission so we can get out of here."
11175 "I hate Siberia."
11176 "People have been exiled to Siberia since time of Genghis Khan."
11177 "Siberians make good butter, though."
11178 "Also, Lake Baikal is very beautiful in summertime."
11179 "Did you know it's largest body of fresh water in whole world?"
11180 "Eh, it's not bad place to live."
11181 "Your pilot has been captured."
11182 "They're interrogating him in the supply building."
11183 "You'd better liberate him if you want to come home."
11184 "Have you heard from Tania?"
11185 "I got a letter from her last week. She's staying with her mother in Omsk."
11186 "Has she decided?"
11187 "Not yet."
11188 "What's taking her so long?"
11189 "Her friends don't like me. They want her to go back to her ex-boyfriend."
11190 "I thought he used to beat her."
11191 "He did. But he's a political officer. I'm a low ranked soldier in Siberia."
11192 "Women."
11193 "I heard you used to be stationed in Moscow."
11194 "Da."
11195 "So how did you end up in this place?"
11196 "I asked my commanding officer about getting new socks after I got frostbite on my foot. He said... You think you're cold now? Wait till you get to Siberia."
11197 "I ended up here by accident. I got on a train for Petrograd and it dropped me off in Minsk. I tried to explain I wasn't stationed here, but no one believed me."
11198 "Couldn't they just look it up?"
11199 "Just because they keep all those records doesn't mean they can make any sense out of them. I found out I was never even reported missing from my post in Petrograd."
11200 "Where's Mikhail?"
11201 "Filing duty in the main records building."
11202 "Why? What did he do?"
11203 "Zhukov caught him with an American magazine."
11204 "Pornography?"
11205 "Worse. Investment planning."
11206 "I never would have figured Mikhail for a Capitalist swine."
11207 "He said he was using it for toilet paper because they've been out for three weeks and he didn't want to soil patriotic literature."
11208 "And Zhukov still punished him?"
11209 "If you ask me, he just wanted the magazine. He couldn't confiscate it if he didn't punish Mikhail."
11210 "Now that you mention it, Zhukov IS getting close to retirement."
11211 "How do they expect us to stay fit eating this gruel?"
11212 "I miss borscht."
11213 "I miss pirogi."
11214 "I miss bread."
11215 "But we HAVE bread."
11216 "I'd rather eat rocks. You can kill a rabbit with this bread."
11217 "Actually, that's not a bad idea."
11218 "Rabbit stew?"
11219 "I'm patrolling the west perimeter tomorrow. I'll hunt, you cook."
11220 "It's a deal."
11221 "Have they found out what's wrong with the communications relay?"
11222 "I haven't heard."
11223 "Well, stay alert. It might have been sabotage."
11224 "Have you seen Mikhail?"
11225 "He was filing documents down the hall."
11226 "He's not there now."
11227 "Maybe he's in the restroom."
11228 "I already checked."
11229 "Smoking a cigarette?"
11230 "I searched everywhere. He's just gone."
11231 "He could have gone back to the barracks."
11232 "In the middle of a shift? He's on duty for another 11 hours."
11233 "How could he just vanish?"
11234 "Boris vanished last month."
11235 "Boris went AWOL. He must have."
11236 "Without taking his coat? Or his hat?"
11237 "This is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. People don't just vanish without a trace."
11238 "Tell that to Mikhail."
11239 "You're new here, aren't you."
11240 "I was transferred from Novgorod to work on Project: Omega."
11241 "I've heard of that. What is it, anyway?"
11242 "I'm not sure. Nobody told me anything about it. I've spent three days trying to find information."
11243 "Did you check the M-9 mainframe?"
11244 "It's out of order. One of the vacuum tubes blew and nobody can find a replacement."
11245 "I saw one in the basement the other day."
11246 "Where?"
11247 "I don't remember exactly. Either on a shelf or in a cabinet."
11248 "How much longer do we have to put up with them?"
11249 "Until the project's finished."
11250 "How long is that?"
11251 "Nobody's sure. I don't think anybody even knows what it is."
11252 "It better be soon. I'm running out of patience."
11253 "I'm sure they're terrified."
11254 "They should be."
11255 "She may try to come this way. Stay alert!"
11256 "What's the situation?"
11257 "We got us a spy on the loose."
11258 "CIA?"
11259 "Heck if I know. Can't get straight answers out of anybody around here."
11260 "All right! Close in!"
11261 "Shoot to kill!"
11262 "Hello... Hello, my name is... Hello, my name is Tom Goodman. Yes, I'm Tom Goodman, master spy. Hey, sugar, ever made it with a spy? The name's Tom Goodman. They call me Tom. Well, hello, there... crap! "
11263 "This is the audio diary of Tom Goodman, volume 1, August 7, 1965. My spy training kit arrived in the mail today from Mr. X. It includes a UNITY field manual, a telephone monitoring device, and this tape recorder. I've decided to keep a log of my experiences for my memoirs. That way... Dang it!"
11264 "This is the diary of Tom Goodman, volume 2, August 14, 1965. Operation Imitation is proceeding ahead of schedule. It's only been a few weeks since I met Mr. X at that dive in Ft. Lauderdale and already I have become Tom Goodman, secret agent extraordinaire. Tomorrow, I begin Phase Two."
11265 "This is the diary of Tom Goodman, volume 3, August 27, 1965. I've installed my top secret spy headquarters in the basement. I call it my inner sanctum. It is what separates me from ordinary men. The entrance is carefully hidden so that enemy agents won't find it. They'll have to torture me if they want in."
11266 "This is the diary of Tom Goodman, volume 4, September 17, 1965. There's been an unfortunate setback. I've got the look, I've got the walk, I've got the moves, but I'm still not getting the chicks. Mr. X hasn't been helpful. I'm starting to wonder if he takes me seriously. What does he think I am, a sock puppet? Huh? Is that it, Mr. X? You think you can just stick your hand up my butt and make me dance? Tom Goodman dances for nobody."
11267 "Diary of Tom Goodman, volume 5, December 9, 1965. A breakthrough at last. She wasn't good-looking and she smelled like a horse, but she was woman enough for me. The last obstacle to my success as a super spy has been conquered. As of today, I am no longer a virgin. Yeeeeeeehawwwwww!"
11268 "Find her! Quickly!"
11269 "Wait here."
11270 "Shhh. Listen!"
11271 "Wait here. I'll be back shortly."
11272 "You can't enter."
11273 "This place is not for you."
11274 "I'm sorry, but this area is off limits to you."
11275 "Employees only."
11276 "Go away."
11277 "I said, go away."
11278 "Psst."
11279 "Cate."
11280 "Yoo hoo."
11281 "Grab those Wanted posters before someone recognizes us."
11282 "I bring word from Kamal. He wants to meet with you as soon as possible."
11283 "There's an out of order phone booth near the movie theater. I left a package for you. The combination is 32-46-27. Good luck!"
11284 "Have you seen a blue envelope?"
11285 "No, why?"
11286 "No reason. But if you find it, let me know!"
11287 "Have you seen a blue envelope anywhere?"
11288 "A blue envelope? What's in it?"
11289 "Uh, nothing important. But bring it to me right away if you find it."
11290 "Seen any blue envelopes lying around?"
11291 "The one the boss gave you?"
11292 "What? Oh, yes, I suppose he did."
11293 "I haven't seen it. Must be pretty important, eh?"
11294 "Well, not really. But I should probably find it."
11295 "I'm looking for a blue envelope. Have you seen it?"
11296 "No."
11297 "Are you absolutely sure?"
11298 "Yes."
11299 "Lord Shiva protect me from my own stupidity."
11300 "Aaaaaaaarrrrrrgggghhhhhhh!!!"
11301 "What am I?"
11302 "Help me."
11303 "Gyaaahhhhhh!!!"
11304 "Who are you!?!"
11305 "Who did this to me!?!"
11306 "Abigail, is that you!?!"
11307 "Abigail?!?"
11308 "Abigail!!!"
11309 "Help me!!!"
11310 "Look what they did!!!"
11311 "Abby!?!"
11312 "Please!!!"
11313 "They should be sitting on a table in plain sight."
11314 "I'm sorry to impose on you."
11315 "I'm sure I can figure out some means of dealing with those nasty super soldiers once I can read these documents."
11316 "I wish."
11319 "Say what you like, but this place makes a lot more sense from a business perspective. "
11320 "You're missing the point. Anybody can build an underwater base. Only one or two organizations in the world can afford a space station."
11321 "That's a lot to pay for a little prestige. That hunk of junk almost put us out of business. Whoever blew it up did us a favor."
11322 "Yeah, some favor."
11323 "I'm serious. The insurance settlement paid for this base, the super secret submarine, and new offices in Lisbon, Jakarta, and Orlando. Plus we all got bonuses for the first time ever."
11324 "That stuff's great, but I still say the space station added a lot of value. It's about image. People want to work for successful organizations. Having a space station makes you look successful."
11325 "Until it puts you out of business."
11326 "I give up. Let's just drop it."
11327 "This is the fifth time I've had to switch offices since I started here."
11328 "Management wants to keep the teams together. For efficiency."
11329 "They're not the ones that have to pack up all their crap and haul it down the corridor every three months."
11330 "File a complaint."
11331 "And end up like Pekoe? No, thanks. You can still see him out the porthole on level 2. What's left of him, anyway. The parts the fishes didn't eat."
11332 "All right, already. I just ate."
11333 "Hey, Barbagallo, so how you liking H.A.R.M. so far?"
11334 "This is a pretty classy outfit compared to some of the places I've worked."
11335 "You used to be at CCI, right?"
11336 "Yeah, and Mockery Makery. Buncha low life thugs. It's nice to be working with professionals."
11337 "We've been around a while now. In this business, you adapt or die."
11338 "I hear ya. Only complaint I got is the salute. It's kinda complicated. I'm always worried about leaving part of it out."
11339 "Did anybody explain the symbolism?"
11340 "What symbolism?"
11341 "Watch."
11342 "The first part of the salute is Heart. That stands for desire. The second part is World. The last part is Grab or Take."
11343 "Well, heck, that makes a lot more sense. Thanks!"
11344 "Any time."
11345 "Hey, congratulations on the promotion."
11346 "Yeah, thanks."
11347 "What's wrong?"
11348 "I don't know. It's a lot of responsibility."
11349 "Come on. You'll do fine."
11350 "If you say so."
11351 "What are you worried about? You get along great with everybody."
11352 "I know."
11353 "So what's the problem?"
11354 "Can I be totally honest?"
11355 "Of course!"
11356 "It's my laugh. I don't think it's evil enough."
11357 "Let's hear it."
11358 "So?"
11359 "It could use some work. Try a little deeper."
11360 "Laugh."
11361 "Maybe you just need a motivation. Like an actor. Pretend some goody two shoes spy comes up and says he's gonna arrest you. Except instead of a gat, he's holding a banana."
11362 "Okay. I'll give it a shot."
11363 "See? That's perfect."
11364 "Gee, thanks! I owe you one."
11365 "Heh, don't be surprised if I collect. Now that you're a manager and all."
11366 "Rick said you slept in the lounge again last night."
11367 "I couldn't get my door open. It's those stupid voice activated locks."
11368 "Yeah, the system can't really handle fluctuations in pitch or tempo, so you've got to say things exactly the same each time."
11369 "How am I supposed to do that?"
11370 "Easy. Get yourself a tape recorder. Works like a charm."
11371 "That's against regulations."
11372 "Maybe so, but sleeping in the lounge is against my principles."
11373 "These uniforms sure look a lot better than the old ones, but the fabric is really uncomfortable."
11374 "Yeah, well, they blew most of their budget the first time, so they couldn't afford the same material."
11375 "I hope I don't get a rash."
11376 "Did you hear we basically swept the Evil Academy Awards?"
11377 "Yeah, but I don't get it. Project: Lambda was a disaster."
11378 "Sure, but name one organization that pulled off a successful caper last year."
11379 "Good point."
11380 "We lost out to Evil Alliance in logo design and Misery, Inc. in the fashion categories, but you gotta admit Lambda showed a lot of ambition and panache."
11381 "I'll be waiting to see what happens next year. I think Omega is gonna turn a lot of heads."
11382 "There's got to be another way out of here!"
11383 "My mom is gonna be devastated. My big brother was aboard the space station when it disintegrated."
11384 "Stop talking that way. We're gonna make it out of here. We just have to use our heads."
11385 "I need you to shut down the security system."
11387 "Get that fire contained!"
11388 "We're working on it!"
11389 "Work harder! Those flames are eating up our oxygen."
11390 "Where the hell is that stupid secret door? Huh?"
11391 "Get a hold of yourself."
11392 "We're gonna die unless we get off this deathtrap. And you're telling me to get a hold of myself?"
11393 "Panicking won't help."
11394 "Wow, what a blinding insight! Panicking won't help? Oh, then maybe I should just stop. Except I'm panicking, which means I'm not in control of myself, you big, dumb idiot!"
11395 "Seal the main exit."
11396 "All right, spread out and search."
11397 "Richards, take Mulroy and go help secure the power station. We can't afford to let her get in there."
11398 "All security teams, report at once."
11399 "I want the girl found immediately."
11400 "Ms. Archer, I seem to have underestimated you. I won't make the that mistake again."
11401 "Why is she not in custody yet?"
11402 "Ms. Archer, it is I, Dmitrij Volkov. I look forward to our next meeting. I suspect it will be sooner than you think."
11403 "Director, your mother is holding on line 2."
11404 "Oh, bother."
11405 "Attention, all personnel. Assault teams 1 through 4, report to terminal B for mission outfitting."
11406 "We are now at Condition Omega."
11407 "Well, everyone, I'm off to start a war."
11408 "For every minute that Ms. Archer remains at large, we will be deducting one full day's salary from your paychecks. Perhaps THAT will motivate you."
11409 "Hey, there, Klaus, how's it going?"
11410 "Fine, thank you. And yourself?"
11411 "Ah, just hunting for that spy. Don't want my pay getting docked."
11412 "I should probably be helping, but I'm feeling a little unmotivated just now."
11413 "Really, what's the matter?"
11414 "The Director's motivational techniques don't really inspire me. I have some rebellious tendencies in my nature that make me become somewhat resentful when I'm threatened or demeaned."
11415 "I hear ya, but sometimes you gotta swallow your pride."
11416 "True, but I also think it's important to stand up for your principles. If I hunt for the spy as ordered, under threat of salary deductions, I am sending a message that punitive management practices are acceptable."
11417 "I hate to break it to you, buddy, but that's the way all these villain outfits are run. Most of these guys have no prior management experience, they come from screwed up families, they didn't go to college, and they can't take criticism without flying off the handle. It's a drag, but it comes with the territory."
11418 "Just because this behavior is institutionalized doesn't mean it's tolerable. You have to ask yourself, what is my goal and how can I best accomplish it. If you're a manager and you want to get your employees to search for a renegade spy, you can either use incentive or punishment for motivation. Studies show punishment to be considerably less effective."
11419 "You got a point. But around here, punishments can be permanent."
11420 "Well, you must exercise judgment, of course. In this situation, the risk is purely financial, so I'm willing to chance the consequences. If it were life and death, I would probably do as I was told."
11421 "At least you're prudent."
11422 "You have to be."
11423 "All right, buddy, I'm gonna go search. You watch your back."
11424 "Where do you think you're going?"
11425 "We have unfinished business to attend to."
11426 "Last time we met, it was beneath the ice. This time, it is over a lake of boiling artificial lava. How appropriate."
11427 "Close in! Don't let her escape!"
11428 "All right, keep your eyes open!"
11429 "Fan out and proceed to your target areas."
11430 "Let's hold this position."
11431 "We're supposed to rendezvous with Team 4."
11432 "We will, but first we need to make sure the perimeter is secure."
11433 "Oh no!"
11434 "What?"
11435 "I left my lunchbox on the sub!"
11436 "Didn't you go over your mission readiness checklist?"
11437 "I didn't have time. They had me scrubbing toilets. Heck, I almost forgot to grab my gun."
11438 "Well, it's too late to go back now. You can have half of my sandwich."
11439 "Man, I owe you big time."
11440 "We've got a problem. Agent Archer seems to have fallen into a nefarious trap. She's being hunted by ninjas."
11441 "She's supposed to rendezvous with Agent Yamata near the waterfall on the far side of the village. Locate her and get out of there!"
11442 "Spies! Stop them!"
11443 "Where's the girl?"
11444 "She must have slipped through!"
11445 "Search everywhere. She may be hiding."
11446 "Anything?"
11447 "No sign of her."
11448 "Keep looking."
11449 "There she is! I hope you're not too late."
11450 "The car's out of commission. You're going to have to carry her back to the safe house and wait for help."
11451 "There they are!"
11452 "Don't let them escape!"
11453 "Where is everyone?"
11454 "Those fools had orders to guard this area."
11455 "They must have gone on to the waterfall."
11456 "Or maybe they ran into trouble. Keep your eyes open."
11457 "What's going on around here? Why aren't people at their posts?"
11458 "The spy escaped. They're pursuing her."
11459 "Someone has to guard the estate. What if it's a trick? Maybe she's coming back."
11460 "I didn't think of that."
11461 "Stay here. I'll see who else I can find. If there's any sign of trouble, sound the alarm."
11462 "Well done! Help is on the way."
11463 "The drop didn't go as well as we'd hoped. The rally point is a secluded hunting dacha near the installation. Use the radio there to contact mission control for further instructions."
11464 "This is Foxhound."
11465 "Now that Agent Archer has retrieved the information we needed from the mainframe computer at the nearby Soviet installation, we want you to shut down this operation for good."
11466 "Reinforcements have already converged on the site, so getting in there won't be easy. Do whatever it takes. We need that computer destroyed."
11467 "Where's Vladimir?"
11468 "They sent him to the main records building."
11469 "I thought that area was off limits."
11470 "It is. He's been assigned to help assess the damage."
11471 "Poor idiot. That's probably the last we'll ever see of him."
11472 "We don't need explosives. We need manpower. We have to inventory all the files to see what's missing. There are records dating back to the revolution stored in that place."
11473 "That's what I love about the Soviet Union. You ask for accountants, you get nitroglycerine."
11474 "Then maybe we should ask for nitroglycerine."
11475 "I'm afraid they'd just send more."
11476 "Is it safe with that stuff lying around?"
11477 "I had them put it in the basement. It should be safe there until we can arrange to ship it somewhere else."
11478 "It could take weeks to get the paperwork approved."
11479 "Then you'd better get started."
11480 "I'm not kidding around. If I catch you smoking down here again, I'll drag you outside and chop you into fire wood."
11481 "All right, already. I get the point."
11482 "Cigarettes and explosives don't mix."
11483 "This stuff makes me nervous. I want to patrol outside."
11484 "Shut up and do as you're told."
11485 "Those idiots! What did they do?"
11486 "Secure the perimeter. It might have been an accident, but it could have been sabotage. Nobody leaves this base!"
11487 "Very resourceful! You've performed remarkably."
11488 "Agent Archer will need a password in order to infiltrate H.A.R.M. headquarters."
11489 "Magnus Armstrong's friend Kamal is going to help us. First, you'll need to find him. He should have left a note for you."
11490 "No one gets through this gate without paying me."
11491 "A man named Balaji Malpani is responsible for coming up with a new password each day. Obtain a photograph of him."
11492 "He keeps an apartment in the Hotel Happy Guest. Look for him there."
11493 "Balaji visits his mistress every afternoon. Try to locate her apartment. She always keeps flowers outside."
11494 "There's a balcony across from her room. You should be able to photograph Balaji from there."
11495 "You shouldn't have come here. You're a married man."
11496 "But I cannot resist your charms, my delicate peach. I am cursed with forbidden love. It pulses in my loins."
11497 "Yes, I noticed that."
11498 "What must I do to convince you of my love?"
11499 "It is not me you must convince. It is my father."
11500 "Your father? He's so old fashioned. He won't be satisfied unless I marry you."
11501 "If you love me, why won't you prove it?"
11502 "It's complicated."
11503 "You're using me."
11504 "Don't say it like that. It sounds so vulgar."
11505 "Get out."
11506 "Why must we always bicker. Let us embrace and put these trivial matters out of our minds."
11507 "Your first priority is to evacuate Magnus Armstrong."
11508 "Also, search for any additional information on Project: Omega."
11509 "When you're done, plant explosives and level the site."
11510 "Be careful. The place is probably crawling with H.A.R.M. reinforcements by now."
11511 "What happened to the generator?"
11512 "It's out of gas."
11513 "So refuel it!"
11514 "With what?"
11515 "There's got to be some gas around here some where. Look for a jerry can."
11516 "Man, this place is a wreck. It's gonna take weeks to assess the damage."
11517 "I sure hope they figure out why that super soldier went rogue. We can't afford to having those things rampaging every other week."
11518 "Attention all personnel, apparently we still have a mime problem. "
11519 "Intercept teams, report to Temporary Director Lawrie in the cafeteria."
11520 "Good, you made it. Agent Archer just left on an assignment, so you're going to have to mop up."
11521 "The mimes have seized the security office."
11522 "They're taking hostages and planting explosives throughout the building."
11523 "Get rid of those mimes."
11524 "Help me!"
11525 "I'm being pestered by mimes!"
11526 "Oh, thank you! The pain was unbearable!"
11527 "Get away from me, you filthy mimes!"
11528 "Have you no mercy!?"
11529 "I owe you one!"
11530 "What you girly boys need is a good kick in the fancy pants."
11531 "Keep your sissy paws offa me, you perverts."
11532 "I say once we take care of the Commies, we march into France and round up the rest of these clowns. We'd be doing the world a favor."
11533 "You again? Get away from that microphone, Frenchie! Ow!"
11534 "Oh, ho! Once again, I have seized ze microphone."
11535 "Soon this wretched agency will be one big crater. Won't that be nice?"
11536 "You secret agents are no match for my deadly mimes."
11537 "You people have no appreciation for the subtle art of pantomime. I pity you."
11538 "Damn you! I curse your mothers!"
11539 "You haven't heard the last of Pierre, the Mime King!"
11540 "They're everywhere! Do something!"
11541 "Help, they're holding me hostage!"
11542 "Please, no more torture!"
11543 "Oh, thank you! I have a low threshold for performance art!"
11544 "H.A.R.M. and Evil Alliance are close to a mutual assistance agreement. We can't afford to let that happen."
11545 "Fortunately, a disillusioned H.A.R.M. agent has agreed to assist us. His name is Kamal. Locate him and see what he has to offer."
11546 "But I thought we were going to be working together."
11547 "We are, but this transgression cannot go unpunished. This man, Kamal, has insulted our honor. He must not be allowed to live."
11548 "I don't think H.A.R.M. will be happy about us killing him."
11549 "That's why we're going to make it look like an accident."
11550 "But you sent a squad of assassins to chop him into tiny pieces. I don't think they'll believe it was an accident."
11551 "Fool, we'll tell them we thought he was someone else. Besides, they won't let one little murder stand in the way of the treaty."
11552 "Thank you for saving my life."
11553 "H.A.R.M. and Evil Alliance both have headquarters in this area. Search there for information on how to drive a wedge between them."
11554 "Evil Alliance is based in a movie theatre."
11555 "H.A.R.M.'s headquarters is..."
11556 "I don't like the idea of joining forces with those H.A.R.M. guys."
11557 "Why not?"
11558 "I don't trust them. Do you know what their name stands for?"
11559 "No."
11560 "Neither do I. That doesn't make me very comfortable."
11561 "They're strictly third rate."
11562 "So what? They have their own movie theatre. They show movies every Saturday night."
11563 "You have a point, but I'm worried about our reputation. The name H.A.R.M. strikes fear into people's hearts. Nobody takes Evil Alliance seriously. They're a bunch of lazy whiners with huge entitlement issues."
11564 "Don't worry. Everyone will just assume it's a hostile takeover. "
11565 "I don't share your optimism. I think a lot of people will wonder if we've lost our nerve. If it was a hostile takeover, why would we let them keep their identity?"
11566 "Hmm, I didn't think of that."
11567 "Intelligence suggests that H.A.R.M. has dispatched a hit squad to ruin Mr. Jones' vacation. It's up to you to keep that from happening."
11568 "It's very important that Mr. Jones not know we're here or his vacation will be ruined."
11600 "Are you the new secretary?"
11601 "I could sure use a massage."
11602 "Can you make coffee?"
11603 "You're not a very good secretary."
11604 "I tell you they're planning something major. And management isn't lifting a finger to find out what."
11605 "What do you expect?"
11606 "I expect them to do something!"
11607 "Like what? Raid their headquarters? Remember what happened last time we tried that? We're still getting pieces of Vijay in the mail."
11608 "Better than sitting around doing nothing."
11609 "I'm sure they have a plan. You'll see. Everything will be fine."
11610 "If that's supposed to make me feel better, it isn't working."
11611 "I tell you the woman is driving me crazy."
11612 "I warned you not to marry her."
11613 "Not my wife, you idiot. Her mother! She was so sweet and friendly up until the wedding, then she turned into a vicious demon. All she does is complain."
11614 "Maybe you should remind her that she's living in YOUR home."
11615 "Are you crazy? She'd kill me."
11616 "I'm thinking you need to be more assertive."
11617 "You don't know this woman. She's dangerous."
11618 "You work for one of the evilest terrorist organizations on the planet. If anybody in your household is dangerous, my friend, I think it must be you."
11619 "You know, when you put it like that the logic suddenly becomes clear. How can I repay you?"
11620 "Don't mention it. I hate to see a good friend emasculated."
11621 "What a lovely day."
11622 "Hello."
11623 "Good day to you."
11624 "Hi, there."
11625 "Do you find my accent offensive?"
11626 "What? Why would I?"
11627 "It's not real."
11628 "I don't understand."
11629 "I was born and raised in the U.S."
11630 "What? How? But..."
11631 "My parents moved to Philadelphia in the 1930s. I grew up there. Went to American schools, had American friends."
11632 "Then what are you doing here?"
11633 "I've always wanted to see where my family came from. So I put in for a transfer."
11634 "Why are you using a fake accent?"
11635 "To fit in. I wasn't sure how people would react if they found out I was a foreigner. But I worry if I'm overdoing it."
11636 "I have a confession to make. I'm from Detroit."
11637 "You've got to be kidding!"
11638 "I don't think we're the only ones, either. When Vijay gets drunk, I could swear he's got an Oklahoma twang. And I'm almost positive Deepak is British."
11639 "Well, probably better to keep up appearances."
11640 "Good thinking, my friend."
11641 "I got another demerit."
11642 "Don't tell me, let me guess. He thinks your walking against the wind is too understated."
11643 "Oui. He wants a stronger wind."
11644 "He studied from Deveraux."
11645 "Well, that explains it. Deveraux believes the wind must be a tempest. My instructor learned from Jarre. Jarre argues for a playful spring breeze."
11646 "I was taught the wind must be brisk, but never discourteous."
11647 "When I was young, I didn't realize there was so much philosophy in pantomime."
11648 "I don't see why I should have to do it."
11649 "What do you mean? It's your job."
11650 "I didn't sign up for mopping latrines. I signed up to perpetrate despicable acts."
11651 "Show me where in your contract it says you get to do only the fun stuff."
11652 "Look, I'm an expert at what I do, which is causing misery and suffering. I was hired to make people unhappy. You want the latrine mopped? Hire a janitor."
11653 "Sure, as long as you don't mind taking a pay cut to cover their wages."
11654 "Why should I have to pay for it?"
11655 "Because you're the one that doesn't want to pitch in. The rest of us mop latrines when it's our turn. If you don't want to help, you can hire a janitor out of your own salary."
11656 "That's not fair!"
11657 "Why don't you tell Mr. Volkov about it. I'm sure he'll have an opinion on the subject."
11658 "I'm not mopping."
11659 "Suit yourself. Just keep in mind that people who don't mop, get mopped."
11660 "Is that a threat?"
11661 "It's a fact."
11662 "I've been thinking lately. You remember that guy Paulo?"
11663 "You mean the one that whacked Johnny in Spain?"
11664 "Yeah, him."
11665 "Who could forget? I remember last year at the Christmas party. You got a standing ovation after you described what you were gonna do to that guy. That was the nastiest, most graphic revenge fantasy I ever heard. Pure poetry."
11666 "Well, like I said, I been thinking. I've changed my mind."
11667 "You mean you got something worse planned?"
11668 "No, I mean I changed my mind."
11669 "You're not gonna kill him?"
11670 "What's the point? It's not gonna bring Johnny back."
11671 "Yeah, but it's the principle."
11672 "That's what I used to tell myself, but that whole thing was strictly business. I loved Johnny like a brother, but he was a rat."
11673 "Maybe so, but he was our friend."
11674 "What did I just say? I'd have done anything for that punk."
11675 "That's not what it sounds like to me."
11676 "Look, if I kill Paulo, who am I helping? Not Johnny. He's dead. I'd be doing it for me."
11677 "There's nothing wrong with that."
11678 "Yes, there is. See, I know Paulo didn't have nothing personal against Johnny. He was just following orders. How am I gonna feel better icing a guy that was just doing his job?"
11679 "So ice the guy that hired him."
11680 "But Johnny had it coming. I wish things'd worked out different, but they didn't. If I start gunning people down, what will I accomplish?"
11681 "You wearing a bra under there? I'm starting to worry about your manhood. I mean, if you lost your taste for violence, maybe you should become a librarian or something."
11682 "Say that again. To my face. I dare you."
11683 "Lighten up. I'm just having trouble digesting all this."
11684 "It's simple. Johnny got planted because he was bad for business. If I turn around and whack the guy that whacked him, I'm turning a tragedy into a travesty."
11685 "What are you talking about? You're getting some well deserved payback."
11686 "It ain't well deserved! That's what I been trying to say. Johnny got himself killed by being a rat. If you want to blame somebody, blame him. If a guy shoots himself in the head, you don't punish the gun."
11687 "Hmmm, interesting point."
11688 "That's the difference between revenge and justice. I could get revenge by killing Paulo, but I wouldn't be serving justice. Justice is what got Johnny whacked in the first place."
11689 "Did you hear that bastard was planning to do a presentation on Project: Lambda at this year's international crime conference?"
11690 "He wasn't even on the project."
11691 "I know! Can you believe it."
11692 "So they talked him out of doing it?"
11693 "Nah, they just threw him to the sharks."
11694 "That'll shut him up."
11695 "Why do you think there is such a low ratio of women in the criminal industry?"
11696 "Lack of interest, probably."
11697 "You don't think it's sexism?"
11698 "I'm sure there's some of that, but it's not like we get a lot of resumes from women."
11699 "Maybe it's socialization. Maybe girls grow up thinking crime is for men, so they don't consider it as a career option."
11700 "I'll ask my sister what she thinks."
11701 "Whatever happened to their Eiffel Tower plan? Weren't they going to strap rockets to it and fly it to the moon?"
11702 "Budget overruns. I hear they're working on a plan to replace all the paintings in the Louvre with photographs of Elvis Presley."
11703 "Are you sure? That sounds a lot like the job in Barcelona."
11704 "They're calling it a spiritual sequel."
11705 "How disappointing. I was looking forward to something a little more innovative."
11706 "They can still innovate. Just because it's a follow-up doesn't mean it's going to be identical. Think of it as a variation on a theme."
11707 "We'll see."
11708 "That morale officer is a serious liability."
11709 "Aw, come on, she's not that bad."
11710 "How am I supposed to feel intimidating in a pink uniform? And what kind of self respecting evil organization has a slogan like: Good at being bad. Bad at being good?"
11711 "I kind of like it. Besides, it got shot down anyway."
11712 "That's not my point. It never should have been proposed in the first place. Where's the menace?"
11713 "Give her a break. This is her first time in a criminal organization. She used to work at a breakfast cereal company."
11714 "Good Lord!"
11715 "What can I do for you?"
11716 "You can gauge your accuracy by your crosshair. The more blurred it becomes, the less accurate your shots will be. Rapid movement will tend to foul your aim."
11717 "You've entered a potential Hiding Place. If you stand perfectly still, you'll become hidden, which means enemies won't be able to see you unless they come very close. You'll remain hidden as long as you keep quiet. That means you can still Sneak or Crouch-Walk, but be careful not to cause any disturbances."
11718 "You have lock pick. Use it on door knob."
11719 "Get rid of them! Quickly!"
11720 "They must have seen plane."
11721 "Radio is in back room."
11722 "Use radio to contact your boss."
11723 "There's small Soviet outpost to north. You can maybe find gas there."
11724 "Shed is out back."
11725 "Get supplies from shed."
11726 "This path leads back to the plane. There's nothing worth seeing in that direction."
11727 "The bridge is just ahead! Once you cross it, look for the narrow path on your left. It should give you access to the underpinnings."
11728 "I'm busy."
11729 "Come back later. This could take a while."
11730 "Please, give me privacy!"
11731 "Thank you for rescuing me. I'll go back to dacha. I can follow road if you open gate."
11732 "Let me know when coast is clear."
11733 "Here I go!"
11734 "Tell me when it's safe."
11735 "I'm going!"
11736 "Tell me when."
11737 "Cover me!"
11738 "Gate is locked! Open it!"
11739 "Don't leave me here! They'll torture me!"
11740 "Thank you! I'll wait at dacha."
11741 "That's the communications relay tower above you on your right. "
11742 "Refer to your map to keep from getting lost."
11743 "Commandeer a snowmobile and get back to the plane! Hurry!"
11744 "Bad news! H.A.R.M. agents arrived before you. They're going to blow up the plane! Your pilot is hiding, but you're in trouble if they find him."
11745 "The main road has been cut off! You'll have to find another way out of the area!"
11746 "It's a safe bet the police will be looking for you now that they think you killed Kamal's associate. Stay out of their way."
11747 "To use your eavesdropping bug, simply fasten it to a telephone receiver. Make sure you find a place to hide until the conversation ends, then activate the bug to play back the recording."
11748 "You may visit the restroom, but you're not allowed beyond the security gates."
11749 "As I explained, you're not allowed past the security gates."
11750 "No more sneaking around!"
11751 "I told you to stay here!"
11752 "Your rambunctious behavior is beginning to irritate me."
11753 "If you're seen, the guards will attempt to apprehend you. Stay out of their clutches or they'll escort you back to the lobby!"
11754 "Here's your stupid purse. I can't believe you made me stand here with that girly little thing. It's unseemly."
11755 "Look what you did, you idiot!"
11756 "Me? This is YOUR fault!"
11757 "MY fault!?! You weren't even looking where you were going!"
11758 "THAT is an exaggeration. Maybe I looked away for a second, but you're the one who came racing around the corner like a maniac!"
11759 "I thought I saw a monkey."
11760 "So did I! That's why I was looking back."
11761 "Likely story! Why would a monkey chase YOU?"
11762 "Sometimes they smell my bananas. Last week a mob of them attacked me. They stole half my stock!"
11763 "They're always after my mangoes too."
11764 "It seems we have a common enemy, my friend."
11765 "You don't suppose..."
11766 "Suppose what?"
11767 "Can it be a coincidence that two fruit vendors should glimpse monkeys at the exact same moment, at the exact same street corner, causing them both to panic simultaneously, resulting in a collision that disables both carts?"
11768 "You mean THEY engineered this? Those BASTARDS!!!"
11769 "Be wary, my friend. They may attack at any moment!"
11770 "They have guns!!!"
11771 "Watch out for snipers on the balconies!"
11772 "Hold on tight!"
11773 "Uh oh!"
11774 "All right, girlie, hang on!"
11775 "Watch out for those mimes!"
11776 "He's trying to block the street!"
11777 "Hurry! He's closing the gates!"
11778 "Shoot the lock on that gate!"
11779 "Hurry and shoot that lock!"
11780 "I'm feeling a bit winded."
11781 "We're gaining on him!"
11782 "Up on that balcony!"
11783 "Hold tight! Sharp turn dead ahead!"
11784 "Don't expect me to hold your purse for you this time."
11785 "Help me! The gate is locked! There's nowhere to run!"
11786 "Run for your life! It's right behind me!"
11787 "Bring more water!"
11788 "Hurry! The ice cream is melting!"
11789 "It's no use! The fire is out of control!"
11790 "Help me, someone!!!"
11791 "I'm in big trouble!"
11792 "Agent Archer! Over here!"
11793 "He's going to kill me!"
11794 "You seen Carter lately?"
11795 "Didn't you hear? They caught him trying to arrange an interview with Vengeance Factory. He had the plans for Project Epsilon in his portfolio.  So they turned him into a Man-Crate."
11796 "Jeez. Serves him right. That's the problem with this industry. Criminals just have too many entitlement issues to put the TEAM first."
11797 "Cornelius Fitchpins, Ensign Third Class."
11798 "Boy, Kitchener's really bucking for a promotion. He's been begging me to transfer him to the Director's office as an end table."
11799 "Can you blame him? Let me tell you something, pal, life as a Man-Crate isn't exactly glamorous."
11800 "Hey, no disrespect intended. I just think he's going about it all wrong. You do a good job as furniture, it could turn into a career. The most you can look forward to is getting moved to a nicer room. Me? I'd teach myself how to roll so I could catch some spies."
11801 "Are you feeling any better today, Chuck?"
11802 "No, my deformed friend. Like all quantities, horror has its ultimate. And I'm that."
11803 "Hey, that's from The Brain That Wouldn't Die, right? I love that movie. I never thought I'd be able to relate to Jan in the Pan."
11804 "Hold on, Mikey! I'll figure something out."
11805 "Okay."
11806 "Any luck?"
11807 "Almost."
11808 "Ow! Stop it!"
11809 "Get off! You're smashing me!"
11810 "Welcome to the Man-Handler, H.A.R.M.'s latest all-purpose death trap and automated torture device. Let's take a look at what today's victim has in store, shall we?"
11811 "Man-Crate! That's right, folks, the victim is about to become a living block of human misery. The perfect punishment for all those naughty boys and girls who need a reminder of how completely and utterly insignificant they are. The procedure is even 65 percent reversible, which means you can reward your Man-Crates for good behavior by turning them into pale, quivering shadows of their former selves!"
11812 "Heat up the griddle and get your spatulas ready! We're making Man-Cakes!"
11813 "How about a bowl of chunky Manhattan-style Man-Chowder!?"
11814 "Mama mia! It looks like today's victim is in for MAXIMUM PUNISHMENT! Get ready for the main course, ladies and gentlemen! We're having spaghetti with Man-Sauce!"
11815 "First, the victim will face the crushing agony of the mighty TENDERIZERS!!! Next up are the HOWLING SAWBLADES!!! Followed by the infernal FLAME JETS!!! And leading finally to the swirling agony of the MAN-BLENDER!!! "
11816 "This will be the first time the Man-Handler has been used at its highest setting. There's a lot of anticipation in the air today, ladies and gentlemen. Well, let's MAN-HANDLE!"
11817 "We seem to be experiencing technical difficulties."
11818 "Director, there's a call... there's an urgent telephone call. For you."
11819 "I see."
11820 "I don't care if he IS the screenwriter's nephew. He'd better end up on the cutting room floor or you'll be hearing from my agent. Yes, Bernard, I realize that, but he's dreadful. Have you seen the dailies? He keeps looking at the camera. I only agreed to do this picture because you begged me. You begged me, Bernard. I was up for a part in The Italian Job, but I turned it down. For you. I could be working with Michael Caine and Noel Coward. Instead I'm stuck with Terence bloody Sloggins the bloody screenwriter's bloody nephew. Goodbye, Bernard. I'm hanging up on you now. "
11821 "I can't breathe! I can't breathe! Can someone move me over by a window!?!"
11822 "Pipe down, boxy. Some of us are trying to sleep."
11823 "So you developed this new artificial lava?"
11824 "Sure did. You like it?"
11825 "Heck, yeah. It's pretty damn spiffy compared to that crap we used to have."
11826 "It can handle temperatures up to 343 kelvins. The previous substance deconstituted at around 313 kelvins. I take baths hotter than that."
11827 "The only problem is it doesn't really look like lava."
11828 "That's actually by design. Our first few prototypes were very naturalistic, but the focus group results weren't where they needed to be. So we said hell with it. Let's just concentrate on making it look cool."
11829 "What was wrong with the realistic stuff?"
11830 "People take reality for granted, so it's hard to impress them with your garden variety liquid magma. Why do you think we have our headquarters in underground caverns? It'd be a lot cheaper and more convenient to lease an office building, but then you get potential clients who don't think you're evil enough for the really high profile operations."
11831 "Makes a lot of sense."
11832 "Take a look at the latest Criminality Monthly. They profile two evil organizations: Misery, Incorporated and Fist of Injustice. If you look at their CVs..."
11833 "What's a CV?"
11834 "Curriculum vitae. Like a resume. Anyway, Misery, Inc. is a way more sophisticated outfit. Fist of Injustice is strictly third rate: kidnappings, extortion, the petty kind of stuff any guy with a two car garage and a mental disorder can pull off. But they've got a much better rep in the criminal industry."
11835 "No kidding. I thought they were pretty much on par with us."
11836 "We've got more evil in our daycare center than they have in their entire organization. But they hired a top rate design firm to help them with their lair."
11837 "Is that the place that's sort of a science fiction medieval dungeon kind of thing? "
11838 "That's the one. I'll bet it's all held together by strings and chewing gum, but it sure impresses the media."
11839 "Look for caches of Anti Super Soldier Serum! You'll need the serum to get rid of the invasion force!"
11841 "So what happened, anyway? I thought you were going to guard the flag."
11842 "Don't even start, girlie."
11843 "I single-handedly fought off a super soldier invasion and you couldn't even handle one little self-infatuated sissy with a target pistol."
11844 "He took me by surprise!"
11845 "Maybe you would have heard him coming if you didn't have your head up your arse."
11846 "Have some sympathy! I was shot! Multiple times!"
11847 "Oh, poor baby."
11848 "Don't you mock me, woman. It stings!"
11849 "Is that so? Well, I was zapped by a laser beam. You do you think THAT feels? Of course, after being impaled on a sword and carried off by a tornado, it's really not so bad."
11850 "You're lucky I'm bleeding to death or I'd teach you a thing or two about respect."
11851 "Bleeding to death?"
11852 "All right, maybe that's a slight exaggeration."
11853 "Not that it makes a difference. I'll take you on any time, anywhere."
11854 "I'll tell you what the password is. It's... Balaji Malpani better shape up or he's going to die a very slow, painful death. Got that!?! Good BYE!!!"
11855 "Head through this gate! It leads out to the street!"
11856 "I'm on my coffee break. Come back later."
11857 "The helicopter's on its way! You'll have to hold out until it arrives. We think enemy reinforcements are closing in on your position, so brace yourself for a fight!"
11858 "It's too late to rescue Armstrong. Find out where they're taking him!"
11859 "We're airdropping explosives to you now! Recover them and place them around the compound."
11860 "Intercept teams, report to Temporary Director Lawrie in the lobby."
11861 "Rescue any hostages and get rid of those filthy mimes!"
11862 "Sacre bleu!"
11863 "Cate, where are you going? Your pilot is still a prisoner!"
11864 "A man with a carnation? Haven't seen him."
11865 "They say that murder victim was stabbed, shot, and stomped on by an elephant. How horrible!"
11866 "No, I haven't seen anyone wearing a carnation."
11867 "Need someone to show you around? I'VE been around."
11868 "A carnation? Sorry, no idea."
11869 "Maybe I can clear my calendar tonight and take you to dinner."
11870 "Perhaps you can ask the flower vendor."
11871 "Yes, I saw a man with a carnation. He was here a short time ago."
11872 "I heard someone was murdered near here!"
11873 "Wearing a carnation? No, I'm sorry."
11874 "Did you hear about the murder? What is this neighborhood coming to?"
11875 "Why don't you ask the florist?"
11876 "What did they look like?"
11877 "The man was about 6 feet tall with a bushy red beard, wearing a skirt."
11878 "You mean a kilt?"
11879 "I don't know much about women's fashion. Anyway, the girl looked European with brown hair, an orange shirt, and striped pants. She was the one with the gun."
11880 "But the victim was stabbed."
11881 "Just arrest them. We'll sort out the details later."
11882 "Yes, a man bought a pink carnation from me just a few minutes ago. Are you his friend? He dropped that."
11883 "Who's been eating my mango chutney!?! My mother made that for ME!!!"
11884 "Hello, there."
11885 "Where is that idiot woman? She was supposed to be here 20 minutes ago."
11886 "A man was killed behind the Hotel Happy Guest! They say it was a gang of bandits!"
11887 "It's so hot today!"
11888 "I'm told a family was mauled by wild dogs at the Hotel Happy Guest. How tragic!"
11889 "I wish those gangsters had taken over a different movie theater. This one had such comfortable seats."
11890 "You, there. I bring word from Kamal. He wants to meet you."
11891 "Sadly, I forgot where I saw him. You'll have to find him yourself."
11892 "Like you, I am a victim of injustice. I have been driven away from my precious gate by nasty policemen."
11893 "I realize you must find me irresistible, but I'm tired of talking to you."
11894 "Go away."
11895 "The acting was terrible! And the special effects? The blood looked like red paint!"
11896 "It was arterial spray. It's brighter because it contains more oxygen. And how can you criticize the acting considering the movies YOU like?! I give up."
11897 "My favorite part is where she starts to undress and then the truck drives through the wall. I was laughing so hard soda shot out of my nose."
11898 "I like the scene in the bar with the guy with the thing and the other guy with the eye patch? I thought I was going to have to be hospitalized from laughing too much. What a great movie."
11899 "Put out this fire!"
11900 "You, there! I said put out this fire!"
11901 "I'm waiting to be rescued."
11902 "It's about time."
11903 "Hello, Agent Archer. How are you today?"
11904 "Are you, are you actually talking to me? Wow."
11905 "Hi, Cate. Mildred said to thank you for the flowers. She's feeling much better."
11906 "Mulligatawny? Wrong. Get lost."
11907 "This way! Come on! "
11908 "Follow me! "
11909 "Over here! "
11910 "Hurry! "
11911 "In here! "
11912 "Abigail..."
20000 "empty"
20001 "empty"
20002 "empty"
20003 "empty"
20138 "Oh!"
20140 "I'm bleeding!"
20141 "What are you doing!"
20142 "No, please!"
20143 "You are a horrible person!"
20147 "Here, kitty!"
20148 "What are you thinking?"
20149 "Put away that thing!"
20150 "You're making me nervous!"
20154 "Help, I'm stuck!"
20155 "I'm suddenly quite immobile!"
20156 "No!"
20157 "Oh no!"
20180 "Please!"
20182 "Hmm."
20183 "I don't feel well at all."
20184 "Hm?"
20185 "What's this?"
20186 "It's the girl from the poster!"
20187 "Police!"
20190 "I can't see!"
20603 "Oh!"
20605 "I'm bleeding!"
20606 "What are you doing!"
20607 "No, please!"

25003 "Ninja Clan Memo: Patrols@To all clan members:\n\nWe expect the spy to enter the village from the east, where most of the best tourist attractions are concentrated, but it's also possible she'll approach from the direction of the falls. Please report to your assigned posts promptly this evening. It is recommended you eat before your shift begins, as our food budget was used up by last month's attack on the Oshii clan headquarters.\n\nHaruko Muroi\nAssistant Administrator"
25004 "UNITY Dossier: Ninjas@Cate,\n\nWhile information on the ninja clan in Inotakimura is somewhat scarce, we have been able to ascertain the following details:\n\n- Ninjas are trained to lunge great distances for powerful strikes against their enemies.\n\n- They can use smoke bombs to vanish, often reappearing close to their targets for surprise attacks.\n\nI hope this information proves helpful. Take care of yourself.\n\nBruno Lawrie\nSenior Field Operative\nUNITY Special Operations Division"
25005 "UNITY Memo: Bonus objectives@Agent Archer,\n\nSometimes you will come across opportunities for bonus assignments which you can complete for additional Skill Points. Keep your eyes open for intelligence items such as notes, briefcases, or letters.\n\nHere's a simple optional objective for practice: I've scattered six pages from the UNITY field manual throughout the general area. Collect them all before moving on.\n\nSanta,\nDirector of Gadgetry\nUNITY Toymaker Division"
25006 "UNITY Manual: Searching@SEARCHING\n\nEnemies often carry valuable items such as ammunition, armor, first aid, or important documents, so be sure to search them thoroughly by holding down the Action button until the progress bar disappears. You may want to move your victims into the shadows before searching them to avoid drawing unwanted attention.\n\nYou can also search filing cabinets and stacks of paper for hints and useful intelligence items. It is often by searching that you will find bonus objectives."
25007 "UNITY Manual: Unconscious enemies@UNCONSCIOUS ENEMIES\n\nEnemies that are knocked unconscious, such as by a taser or sleeping gas, will eventually wake up. They may also be roused by their comrades.\n\nYou can disarm unconscious enemies by searching them, thereby eliminating them as a threat unless they obtain a replacement weapon."
25008 "UNITY Manual: Action button@ACTION BUTTON\n\nWhen you target an object or character you can interact with, text will appear at the center of the screen to indicate what will happen when you press the Action button (default: Right Mouse Button). If the text is grayed out, you cannot interact with the item until some condition is met. For example, you may have to unlock a door or acquire a necessary inventory item.\n\nThe Action button will reload your currently selected weapon (assuming it can be reloaded) if nothing is targeted."
25009 "UNITY Manual: Hiding@HIDING\n\nWhenever you enter a potential hiding place, the Hiding Place icon will appear at the bottom of your screen. If you stand perfectly still, you will momentarily become hidden, at which point enemies won't see you until they're right upon you. You will stay hidden as long as you remain in the hiding place and don't move quickly or fire a weapon.\n\nIf you can't hide because an enemy knows where you are, the icon will be crossed out."
25010 "UNITY Manual: Intelligence items@INTELLIGENCE ITEMS\n\nBe sure to search everywhere for important documents. Some may contain information vital to your current mission. Others may give you Skill Point rewards.\n\nDocuments you pick up can be viewed at any time during a mission by accessing the Intelligence screen (default hotkey: I)."

Keep an eye out for foiled-wrapped presents like this one.\n\nThe coins you'll find in this package are worth more than their face value suggests, as you can throw them to distract enemies. You can even lure enemies away from their posts by tossing a coin around a corner or into an alley.\n\nSanta"
25013 "Reminder: Mission status@MISSION SCREEN\n\nConsult the Mission screen (default hotkey: Tab) for information on your current assignment. Here you will find your current objectives, which you must complete in order to accomplish your mission. Optional objectives (secondary tasks you can perform for bonus Skill Points) are also listed here, along with Parameters, which are general guidelines or rules of conduct. Violating parameters may result in forfeited Skill Point rewards or even mission failure."
25014 "Reminder: Equipment screen@EQUIPMENT SCREEN\n\nWhenever you acquire new weapons, gadgets, or ammunition, remember that you can consult the Equipment screen (default hotkey: M) at any time for information on their features and uses. This screen also lets you select equipment and ammunition or gadget functions while the game is paused."
25015 "Reminder: Skill points@SKILL POINTS\n\nYou will be awarded Skill Points for overcoming certain obstacles or accomplishing specific objectives. Access the Player screen (default hotkey: P) to spend these points to improve your abilities. Consider your playing style carefully before investing your points."
25016 "Reminder: Neutralizing enemies@NEUTRALIZING ENEMIES\n\nYou can dispatch enemies stealthily by using quiet weapons like the taser, crossbow, or a silenced pistol. If enemies are alerted to your presence, they will cry out when injured, attracting attention."
25017 "Reminder: Moving bodies@MOVING BODIES\n\nEnemies will become alarmed if they see a fallen comrade, but you can use the Move Body key (default: G)to pick up incapacitated adversaries and drop them somewhere out of the way. You won't be able to run or use a weapon when carrying a body, so time your movements carefully."
25018 "Reminder: Disturbances@DISTURBANCES\n\nEnemies can hear just about any sound you can, so learn to move carefully. You can Sneak (default: Left Shift) to move silently. Also, certain materials (such as grass, carpet, or snow) will muffle your footfalls, while other materials (such as metal or ceramic tile) amplify sound. \n\nAlso, bumping into wind chimes or knocking over a bottle can cause a disturbance, so watch your step."
25019 "Reminder: Leaning@LEANING\n\nLean around corners (default: Q and E) to see what lies ahead. Don't peek too long or enemies may come to investigate."

25023 "UNITY Manual: Difficulty@DIFFICULTY SETTINGS\n\nKeep in mind that you can adjust the difficulty of your mission at any time by bringing up the Options menu, selecting Game, and choosing the desired setting. Difficulty settings primarily affect how much damage enemies do to you, so if you find yourself becoming frustrated or not feeling challenged enough, try modifying the setting to suit your needs."
25024 "UNITY Manual: Saving@SAVING\n\nRemember to save your progress from time to time, either by using the Save Game option in the System menu or the Quicksave key (F6). Also, keep in mind that your progress is autosaved whenever you enter a new area, so you have the option of restarting the level if necessary."
25025 "UNITY Manual: Distractions@DISTRACTIONS\n\nOne of the most effective means of slipping past enemy agents is to distract them. For example, you can toss a coin down a dark alley to lure guards away from their posts. If the threat of an intruder doesn't get their attention, the distinctive chime of loose change on pavement surely will. If you don't have a coin, you can always improvise with your crossbow. Just don't cause too much of a ruckus or you'll alarm your enemies."

25042 "Letter from Isako: Page 2@Perhaps if you understand the circumstances of my obligation you will appreciate my reasoning. After my parents were murdered, I was found wandering the streets of Kyoto by an old woman.

25043 "Letter from Isako: Page 3@When I turned 14, I was sent on my first assignment: to assassinate a greedy merchant who had been stealing girls from their families to use as prostitutes in his gambling dens. It was a simple task, but I was captured before I could kill him, having been betrayed by the very man who had commissioned the assassination. He had tricked us so that he could apprehend me and earn his master's favor."
25044 "Letter from Isako: Page 4@Before the merchant could have me put to death, his European friend intervened, asking that I be spared so that I might work for him. The merchant agreed, and the Director, for that's who it was, became my new master.

Attack\nHistorically, the inhabitants of Khios have been able to rely on the overwhelming tactical advantage afforded by the island's unforgiving terrain. No conventional invasion force has ever come close to making the long, treacherous climb from the shore. All the defenders have to do is pour some boiling oil down the stairwell and the assault is over. Our Super Soldiers will render any such tactics useless and allow us to quickly crush any organized resistance."
25932 "Invasion plan, part III@Khios Invasion Plan\n\nPart III. Occupation\nOnce the island has been secured, we will begin Operation Occupation Nation Emancipation Initiation. Phase One starts with a thorough inventory of the island's surviving residents, followed by Phase Two, in which we sell them all to a pharmaceutical company for medical experimentation. For Phase Three, we'll issue a statement to the international press announcing the establishment of the H.A.R.M. Happy Adventure Theme Park Island."

She's planning a surprise visit from next week until sometime in October and wants me to prepare the guest house for her. I offered to book her tickets for her, but she said she doesn't want to end up in Burma this time. What should I do?"
25943 "H.A.R.M. Memo: Director's Mother@To: Carly Isadora Tehore, Activities Coordinator\nFrom: Associate Commander Gudmundson\n\nThere's no need for panic. We have contingency plans for emergencies such as this. According to my records, we averted the last visit with Excuse 47: Company Holiday in East Detroit. This time I think we're going to need to skip down to Excuse 66: Quarantine Due to Outbreak of Scarlet Fever."

Shoot them with the serum while they are powered down. Be quick or they'll recover and you'll have to knock them out again!\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Schenker"

32905 "Who turned off the lights?"
32906 "Have I gone blind?"
32907 "Who turned on the lights?"
32908 "The light! It stings!"
32909 "You can't hide from me."
32910 "Now I've got you!"
32911 "I have been disrobed of my weapon!"
32912 "What has become of my weapon?"
32913 "I've been pillaged!"
32914 "Oh no!"
