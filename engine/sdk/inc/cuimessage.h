/*!  CUIMessage class.  This is used to pass CUI system messages among
widgets in the ILTWidgetManager's hierarchy.  Widget's have almost no
default message handling behavior.  It is up to the Client Shell to enqueue
messages and respond to them in a callback function.

For example:  To deal with a \e mouse \e click, you must first detect the
mouse click in the routine(s) where you poll for input from the mouse,
keyboard, joystick, etc.  You would then enqueue a CUIM_ON_MOUSE_CLICK message
with ILTWidgetManager::EnqueueMessage().  In one of your UI callback
functions, you receive the CUIM_ON_MOUSE_CLICK message, check to see if it
ocurred within the boundaries of the receiving widget, and take appropriate
action in your client code.

There are 2 ways to receive message callbacks, if you want them.  You must set up 
one or more callback functions, and then install it either with CUIBase::SetUserCallback()
or ILTWidgetManager::SetUserCallback().  If you install a user callback for the
ILTWidgetManager, you will receive one instance of every message in the queue
during the update.  If you install one or more CUIBase callbacks, you will receive
an instance of each message for every widget that has installed the same callback.
For example:  If you were to create 3 CUIButtons and a \e ButtonCallback() function,
and call CUIBase::SetUserCallback() for each CUIButton, then you would receive 3 instances
of every message, each one with the CUIMessage::m_pRecipient set to one of the three
CUIButtons.

How you handle message callbacks (or \e if you handle them) is completely up to you.
